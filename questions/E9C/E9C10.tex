\textbf{Which of the following describes a Zepp antenna?}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*]
    \item A horizontal array capable of quickly changing the direction of maximum radiation by changing phasing lines
    \item \textbf{An end-fed half-wavelength dipole}
    \item An omni-directional antenna commonly used for satellite communications

\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you have a piece of string that’s exactly the right length to make a perfect jump rope. Now, if you hold one end of the string and let the other end dangle, you’ve got something like a Zepp antenna! It’s a special kind of antenna that’s fed at one end and is exactly half the length of the radio wave it’s designed to work with. It’s not super fancy or complicated, but it gets the job done really well for certain types of radio communications. Think of it as the reliable old jump rope of the antenna world—simple, effective, and always ready to go!

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
A Zepp antenna, formally known as a Zeppelin antenna, is an end-fed half-wavelength dipole antenna. The term Zepp comes from its historical use on Zeppelin airships. The antenna is characterized by its feeding point at one end, which distinguishes it from center-fed dipoles. 

Mathematically, the length of the antenna \( L \) is given by:
\[
L = \frac{\lambda}{2}
\]
where \( \lambda \) is the wavelength of the operating frequency. This length ensures that the antenna resonates at the desired frequency, maximizing its efficiency.

The antenna operates by creating a standing wave pattern along its length, with the current maximum at the center and voltage maximum at the ends. This configuration allows for efficient radiation of electromagnetic waves. The end-fed nature of the Zepp antenna makes it particularly useful in situations where a center feed is impractical, such as in certain mobile or portable setups.

Related concepts include the dipole antenna, standing wave ratio (SWR), and impedance matching. Understanding these concepts is crucial for designing and optimizing antenna systems for specific applications.
