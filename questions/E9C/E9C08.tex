\textbf{E9C08} What is a folded dipole antenna?
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*)]
    \item A dipole one-quarter wavelength long
    \item A center-fed dipole with the ends folded down 90 degrees at the midpoint of each side
    \item \textbf{A half-wave dipole with an additional parallel wire connecting its two ends}
    \item A dipole configured to provide forward gain
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you have a regular dipole antenna, which is like a straight stick that sends and receives radio waves. Now, picture taking that stick and folding it back on itself, like folding a piece of paper in half. That’s essentially what a folded dipole antenna is! It’s a half-wave dipole antenna with an extra wire that connects the two ends, making it look like a loop. This extra wire helps the antenna work better in certain situations, like when you need to match the antenna to the radio equipment. Think of it as giving your antenna a little upgrade to make it more efficient!

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
A folded dipole antenna is a type of dipole antenna where the two ends of the dipole are connected by an additional parallel wire, effectively forming a loop. This configuration has several advantages:

1. **Impedance Matching**: The folded dipole has a higher input impedance compared to a standard half-wave dipole. The input impedance of a folded dipole is approximately four times that of a simple dipole, which is useful for matching to transmission lines with higher characteristic impedances.

2. **Bandwidth**: The folded dipole typically has a wider bandwidth than a simple dipole, making it more versatile for different frequency ranges.

3. **Radiation Pattern**: The radiation pattern of a folded dipole is similar to that of a standard half-wave dipole, with a bidirectional pattern perpendicular to the antenna axis.

The mathematical representation of the input impedance \( Z_{in} \) of a folded dipole can be derived as follows:

\[
Z_{in} = 4 \times Z_{dipole}
\]

where \( Z_{dipole} \) is the impedance of a simple half-wave dipole, typically around 73 ohms in free space. Therefore, the input impedance of a folded dipole is approximately 292 ohms.

This higher impedance makes the folded dipole particularly useful in applications where impedance matching is critical, such as in certain types of feed lines and antenna systems.
