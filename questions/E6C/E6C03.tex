    \item \textbf{Logic devices with 0, 1, and high-impedance output states}
    \item Logic devices that utilize ternary math
    \item Logic with three output impedances which can be selected to better match the load impedance

\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you have a light switch that can do more than just turn the light on or off. Tri-state logic is like having a third option where the switch doesn't just turn the light on or off, but it also has a do nothing mode. In this mode, the switch doesn't send any signal at all, which is called high-impedance. This is useful when you want to connect multiple devices to the same wire without them interfering with each other. Think of it like a group of people talking on the same phone line; tri-state logic allows only one person to talk at a time while the others stay silent.

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
Tri-state logic refers to digital logic circuits that have three possible output states: logic 0 (low), logic 1 (high), and high-impedance (Hi-Z). The high-impedance state effectively disconnects the output from the circuit, allowing multiple devices to share the same communication line without causing conflicts. This is particularly useful in bus systems where multiple devices need to communicate over a shared set of wires.

Mathematically, the output \( Y \) of a tri-state logic device can be represented as:
\[
Y = \begin{cases}
0 & \text{if the output is logic 0}, \\
1 & \text{if the output is logic 1}, \\
\text{Hi-Z} & \text{if the output is in high-impedance state}.
\end{cases}
\]

The high-impedance state is achieved by disabling the output driver, making the output appear as an open circuit. This is crucial in digital systems where multiple devices need to share a common bus, as it prevents signal contention and allows for efficient communication.
