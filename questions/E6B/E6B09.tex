\textbf{E6B09} What is a common use for point-contact diodes?
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*)]
    \item As a constant current source
    \item As a constant voltage source

\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you have a tiny device that can pick up radio signals from the air, just like how your ears pick up sounds. A point-contact diode is like that tiny device. It is often used to detect radio frequency (RF) signals, which are invisible waves that carry information like music or voices through the air. So, when you hear a radio station, a point-contact diode might be helping to catch those signals and turn them into something you can hear.

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
Point-contact diodes are semiconductor devices that consist of a sharp metal wire in contact with a semiconductor material. They are particularly useful in high-frequency applications due to their low capacitance and fast response time. One of the most common uses of point-contact diodes is as an RF detector. In this role, the diode rectifies the high-frequency alternating current (AC) signal, converting it into a direct current (DC) signal that can be processed by other electronic components.

The operation of a point-contact diode as an RF detector can be understood through the following steps:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The RF signal is applied to the diode.
    \item The diode rectifies the signal, allowing current to flow in only one direction.
    \item The rectified signal is then filtered to remove the high-frequency components, leaving behind a DC signal that represents the original RF signal's amplitude.
\end{enumerate}

This process is crucial in radio receivers, where the RF signal must be detected and demodulated to extract the original information. Point-contact diodes are preferred in such applications due to their ability to operate efficiently at high frequencies, making them ideal for detecting RF signals.
