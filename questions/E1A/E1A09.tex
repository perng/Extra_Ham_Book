\subsection{Max Power on the 630-Meter Band: What You Need to Know!}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=E1A09] Except in some parts of Alaska, what is the maximum power permitted on the 630-meter band?
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*]
        \item 50 watts PEP (peak envelope power)
        \item 100 watts PEP (peak envelope power)
        \item 1 watt EIRP (equivalent isotropic radiated power)
        \item \textbf{5 watts EIRP (equivalent isotropic radiated power)}
    \end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you have a flashlight, and you want to shine it as far as possible. But there are rules about how bright your flashlight can be so it doesn’t bother others. The 630-meter band is like a special channel for radio signals, and there’s a rule about how strong your signal can be. Except in some parts of Alaska, the rule says your signal can’t be stronger than 5 watts EIRP. This is like saying your flashlight can’t be brighter than a certain level.

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
The 630-meter band (472–479 kHz) is part of the low-frequency (LF) spectrum allocated for amateur radio use. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulates the maximum power output to minimize interference with other services and ensure efficient use of the spectrum. The maximum permitted power on this band, except in some parts of Alaska, is 5 watts EIRP (Equivalent Isotropic Radiated Power). EIRP is a measure of the power that would be radiated by an ideal isotropic antenna, which radiates equally in all directions. It is calculated as:

\[
\text{EIRP} = P_t \times G_t
\]

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( P_t \) is the transmitter power,
    \item \( G_t \) is the antenna gain relative to an isotropic antenna.
\end{itemize}

For the 630-meter band, the FCC limits the EIRP to 5 watts, ensuring that amateur radio operators do not cause undue interference with other users of the spectrum. This regulation helps maintain a balance between the interests of amateur radio operators and other services that share or are adjacent to this frequency range.
