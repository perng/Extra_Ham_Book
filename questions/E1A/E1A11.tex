\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you're on a big boat in the middle of the ocean, and you want to use your amateur radio to talk to people far away. The question is asking what kind of permission (license) you need to do this. The answer is simple: as long as you have any amateur radio license from the FCC (the Federal Communications Commission), you're good to go! You don't need any special extra permissions or higher-level licenses. Just your regular amateur radio license is enough to operate your radio on a US-registered boat in international waters.

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
When operating an amateur radio station aboard a US-registered vessel in international waters, the licensing requirements are governed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). According to FCC regulations, any FCC-issued amateur radio license is sufficient for such operations. This means that whether you hold a Technician, General, or Amateur Extra class license, you are permitted to operate your amateur station on a US-registered vessel in international waters.

The key point here is that the license must be issued by the FCC, and there is no requirement for additional endorsements or higher-class licenses. This regulation ensures that amateur radio operators can communicate effectively while adhering to international maritime laws and FCC guidelines.
