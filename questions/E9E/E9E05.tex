What Yagi driven element feed point impedance is required to use a beta or hairpin matching system? 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
    \item \textbf{Capacitive (driven element electrically shorter than 1/2 wavelength)}
    \item Inductive (driven element electrically longer than 1/2 wavelength)
    \item Purely resistive
    \item Purely reactive

\subsubsection*{Related Concepts}

To answer the question regarding the Yagi antenna and the required feed point impedance for using a beta or hairpin matching system, we need to understand several fundamental concepts in radio communication and antenna design.

\subsubsection*{Yagi Antenna Basics}

The Yagi-Uda antenna, commonly known as a Yagi antenna, consists of a driven element, a reflector, and one or more directors. The design of the driven element is critical for the antenna's performance, including its impedance characteristics. 

\subsubsection*{Feed Point Impedance}

The feed point impedance is the impedance presented to the feeding source, typically a coaxial cable. In the case of the driven element being electrically shorter than 1/2 wavelength, the impedance appears capacitive. Conversely, if the driven element is electrically longer than 1/2 wavelength, the impedance becomes inductive. 

The beta or hairpin matching system is specifically utilized when the impedance needs to be matched to achieve efficient transfer of power from the feed line to the antenna. This type of matching utilizes capacitive reactance to ensure that the antenna operates efficiently at resonant frequencies.

\subsubsection*{Calculation Steps}

To elaborate on the concepts involved, let's consider the condition of the driven element length:

1. \textbf{Driven Element Length}: An electrically short Yagi driven element (longer than 1/4 wavelength but shorter than 1/2 wavelength) results in increased capacitive reactance. 

2. \textbf{Matching Requirement}: For a beta match, a driven element that is capacitive (meaning it presents an impedance less than 50$\Omega$ at the feed point) is ideal. Thus, we need to find ways of increasing the reactive component of the system to approach an effective 50$\Omega$.

In a typical scenario, where the driven element length is altered, it is observed that:

\[
    Z_{in} = R + jX \quad \text{where } X < 0
\]

For optimal matching, we introduce additional capacitance to make the reactance zero. The use of a beta match (or hairpin match) provides a selective adjustment:

\[
    C_{match} = j\frac{1}{2\pi f Z_{in}^{\text{target}}} \text{ (ensuring } Z_{in}^{\text{target}} = 50 \Omega\text{)}
\]

\subsubsection*{Conclusion}

Given the information and analysis above, we can conclude that the correct answer to the question is:

\textbf{A: Capacitive (driven element electrically shorter than 1/2 wavelength)}.
