    \textbf{E9E04} What is the purpose of the series capacitor in a gamma match?
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*]
        \item To provide DC isolation between the feed line and the antenna
        \item \textbf{To cancel unwanted inductive reactance}
        \item To provide a rejection notch that prevents the radiation of harmonics
        \item To transform the antenna impedance to a higher value
    \end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you're trying to balance a seesaw. On one side, you have a heavy rock (inductive reactance), and on the other side, you need something to counterbalance it. The series capacitor is like the perfect counterweightâ€”it cancels out the heavy rock, making the seesaw perfectly balanced. In a gamma match, the capacitor does the same thing: it cancels out the unwanted inductive reactance, making sure the antenna works smoothly without any hiccups.

\subsubsection*{Advanced Explanation}
In a gamma match, the series capacitor is used to cancel out the inductive reactance present in the antenna system. The inductive reactance (\(X_L\)) is given by:
\[
X_L = 2\pi f L
\]
where \(f\) is the frequency and \(L\) is the inductance. The capacitive reactance (\(X_C\)) introduced by the series capacitor is:
\[
X_C = \frac{1}{2\pi f C}
\]
where \(C\) is the capacitance. For the reactances to cancel each other out, we need:
\[
X_L = X_C \implies 2\pi f L = \frac{1}{2\pi f C}
\]
Solving for \(C\), we get:
\[
C = \frac{1}{(2\pi f)^2 L}
\]
This ensures that the total reactance in the system is zero, leading to a purely resistive impedance, which is ideal for efficient power transfer from the feed line to the antenna.

The gamma match is a type of impedance matching network used in antenna systems to match the impedance of the feed line to the impedance of the antenna. By canceling the inductive reactance, the series capacitor helps in achieving this impedance match, ensuring maximum power transfer and minimizing reflections.
