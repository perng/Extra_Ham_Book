    \item 1.8 MHz - 1.9 MHz
    \item 10 MHz - 14 MHz

\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you're trying to send a message using the trails left by meteors in the sky. These trails act like mirrors, bouncing your message from one place to another. To make this work best, you need to use a frequency that can easily bounce off these trails. Frequencies that are too low or too high won't work as well. The best range for this is between 28 MHz and 148 MHz. This range is just right for bouncing signals off meteor trails, making it perfect for meteor-scatter communications.

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
Meteor-scatter communication relies on the ionization trails left by meteors in the Earth's atmosphere. These trails can reflect radio waves, allowing for long-distance communication. The optimal frequency range for this type of communication is determined by the ionization density and the height of the meteor trails.

The frequency range of 28 MHz to 148 MHz is particularly suited for meteor-scatter communications because:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Frequencies below 28 MHz tend to be absorbed by the ionosphere or are less effective at reflecting off the relatively short-lived meteor trails.
    \item Frequencies above 148 MHz may pass through the ionosphere without being reflected, reducing their effectiveness for meteor-scatter communication.
\end{itemize}

The ionization trails created by meteors typically exist at altitudes between 80 km and 120 km. The critical frequency for reflection off these trails is influenced by the electron density in the trail, which is highest immediately after the meteor's passage and decreases rapidly. The frequency range of 28 MHz to 148 MHz aligns well with the electron densities typically found in these trails, ensuring efficient reflection and communication.

Mathematically, the critical frequency \( f_c \) for reflection can be approximated by:
\[
f_c \approx 9 \sqrt{N_e}
\]
where \( N_e \) is the electron density in electrons per cubic meter. For typical meteor trails, \( N_e \) ranges from \( 10^{10} \) to \( 10^{12} \) electrons/m\(^3\), resulting in critical frequencies within the 28 MHz to 148 MHz range.
