\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you have a water pipe with a certain amount of resistance to the flow of water. Now, think of a capacitor as a device that can store and release water quickly, creating a kind of back-and-forth effect. The impedance \(50 - j25\) ohms tells us that there is a resistance of 50 ohms (like the pipe's resistance) and a capacitive reactance of 25 ohms (like the capacitor's effect). The negative sign in front of the \(j25\) indicates that the reactance is capacitive, meaning it behaves like a capacitor, not an inductor.

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
Impedance is a complex quantity that combines resistance (\(R\)) and reactance (\(X\)) in a circuit. It is represented as \(Z = R + jX\), where \(j\) is the imaginary unit. In this case, the impedance is given as \(50 - j25\) ohms. Here, the real part (50) represents the resistance, and the imaginary part (-25) represents the reactance. The negative sign indicates that the reactance is capacitive, meaning it is due to a capacitor. Therefore, the impedance \(50 - j25\) ohms represents a circuit with 50 ohms of resistance in series with 25 ohms of capacitive reactance.

To further understand, the impedance of a capacitor is given by:
\[
Z_C = \frac{1}{j\omega C} = -j\frac{1}{\omega C}
\]
where \(\omega\) is the angular frequency and \(C\) is the capacitance. The negative sign confirms that the reactance is capacitive.
