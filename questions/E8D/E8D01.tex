    \textbf{Question ID: E8D01} \\
    Why are received spread spectrum signals resistant to interference? 
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
        \item \textbf{Signals not using the spread spectrum algorithm are suppressed in the receiver}
        \item The high power used by a spread spectrum transmitter keeps its signal from being easily overpowered
        \item Built-in error correction codes minimize interference
        \item If the receiver detects interference, it will signal the transmitter to change frequencies
    \end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Spread spectrum signals are like a secret language that only certain people can understand. Imagine if you were talking in a room full of people, and everyone else was making noise. If you used a special way of talking that spread your voice out over many different sounds, it would be hard for others to understand what you were saying, even if they were trying to listen. This is how spread spectrum works! It helps the signals to stay clear and understand each other even when thereâ€™s a lot of noise around.

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
To understand why spread spectrum signals are resistant to interference, we need to look at some key concepts: 

1. **Spread Spectrum Technique**: This technique spreads the transmitted signal over a wide frequency band. There are different methods to achieve this, such as Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS) and Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS).

2. **Interference Resistance**: The primary reason for interference resistance in spread spectrum signals is that they occupy a wide range of frequencies. When interference occurs on certain frequencies, the spread spectrum signal still has a significant part that remains unaffected by the interference.

3. **Signal Processing in Receivers**: Spread spectrum receivers use specific algorithms to filter out the noise and zeros in on the desired signal. This means that even if some part of the signal is disturbed, the receiver can still reconstruct the original message accurately.

To elaborate, consider that the correct choice is **A**: Signals not using the spread spectrum algorithm are suppressed in the receiver. This emphasizes that the design of spread spectrum technology inherently allows it to ignore signals that do not conform to its expected patterns, effectively reducing the impact of unwanted signals.

If we find ourselves needing to represent this concept visually, a graphic illustrating the frequency spread of a spread spectrum signal versus a narrowband signal would be beneficial.
