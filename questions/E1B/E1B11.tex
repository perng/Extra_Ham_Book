    \textbf{Question E1B11:} What does PRB-1 require of state and local regulations affecting amateur radio antenna size and structures?
    
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*)]
        \item No limitations may be placed on antenna size or placement
        \item \textbf{Reasonable accommodations of amateur radio must be made}
        \item Such structures must be permitted when use for emergency communications can be demonstrated
        \item Such structures must be permitted if certified by a registered professional engineer
    \end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you have a big treehouse in your backyard, and you want to put up a flagpole so you can see it from far away. Now, your neighbors might have rules about how tall the flagpole can be or where you can put it. PRB-1 is like a rule that says the neighbors have to be fair and let you put up your flagpole, as long as it’s not causing any big problems. So, they can’t just say “no” without a good reason. They have to work with you to find a way that makes everyone happy.

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
PRB-1, or the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Memorandum Opinion and Order PRB-1, was issued in 1985 to address the issue of state and local regulations that could potentially restrict amateur radio operations. Specifically, PRB-1 mandates that state and local governments must make reasonable accommodations for amateur radio operators when it comes to antenna size and placement. This means that while local authorities can impose regulations, they cannot outright prohibit amateur radio antennas without considering the needs of the operators.

The key principle here is the balance between local zoning laws and the federal interest in promoting amateur radio as a valuable public service, especially in emergency communications. The FCC has recognized that amateur radio operators play a crucial role in disaster response and public safety, and thus, local regulations must not unduly hinder their ability to operate effectively.

In mathematical terms, if \( R \) represents the set of reasonable accommodations and \( L \) represents local regulations, then PRB-1 ensures that:
\[
L \cap R \neq \emptyset
\]
This means that local regulations must intersect with reasonable accommodations, ensuring that amateur radio operators are not unfairly restricted.

\subsubsection{Related Concepts}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{FCC Regulations}: The Federal Communications Commission sets rules for radio communications in the United States, including amateur radio.
    \item \textbf{Zoning Laws}: Local laws that regulate land use, including the placement and size of structures like antennas.
    \item \textbf{Emergency Communications}: The use of amateur radio in disaster response and public safety, which is a key justification for PRB-1.
