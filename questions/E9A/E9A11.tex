\subsubsection{Concepts Related to Ground Losses in Vertical Antennas}

To understand the factors that affect ground losses in ground-mounted vertical antennas operating in the HF (High Frequency) band, it is important to consider several concepts in radio communication and antenna theory.

\subsubsection{Soil Conductivity}
Soil conductivity is the primary factor that influences ground losses. Ground-mounted vertical antennas rely on the surrounding ground to complete their radio frequency (RF) radiation patterns. The quality of the ground, characterized by its conductivity, plays a vital role in determining how well the antenna can radiate RF energy. High conductivity soils, such as wet, sandy soils, allow for better energy dissipation, resulting in lower losses. Conversely, dry or rocky soils have lower conductivity and can lead to higher losses.

\subsubsection{Other Factors}
While soil conductivity is the correct answer to the question, it is beneficial to briefly discuss the other options: 

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{The standing wave ratio (SWR)}: This is a measure of the efficiency of power transfer from a transmission line to an antenna, but it does not directly influence ground losses.
    \item \textbf{Distance from the transmitter}: While this may affect the strength and quality of the received signal, it does not govern ground losses.
    \item \textbf{Take-off angle}: This refers to the angle at which the radiated signal leaves the antenna. While it affects coverage and range, it does not determine ground losses.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Calculation of Ground Losses}
Calculating the actual ground losses requires knowledge of the soil resistance, which can be derived from soil conductivity (\(\sigma\)). The ground resistance (\(R_g\)) can be calculated using the formula:

\[
R_g = \frac{1}{\sigma A}
\]

where:
- \(R_g\) = ground resistance (Ohms)
- \(\sigma\) = conductivity of the soil (Siemens per meter)
- \(A\) = area of the ground radials (square meters)

For example, if the soil conductivity is \(\sigma = 0.01 \, S/m\) and the area of the radials is \(A = 10 \, m^2\):

\[
R_g = \frac{1}{0.01 \times 10} = \frac{1}{0.1} = 10 \, \Omega
\]

Understanding ground losses and how to mitigate them is crucial for optimizing the performance of ground-mounted vertical antennas in HF communication.
