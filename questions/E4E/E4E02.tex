\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10, colframe=black, title=E4E02`]
Which of the following types of noise can often be reduced by a digital noise reduction? 
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
    \item Broadband white noise
    \item Ignition noise
    \item Power line noise
    \item \textbf{All these choices are correct}
\end{enumerate} \end{tcolorbox}

\subsubsection{Related Concepts}

In radio communication and electronics, noise refers to unwanted electrical signals that can interfere with the desired signal. Understanding the types of noise and their characteristics is essential for effective noise reduction techniques. The following types of noise mentioned in the question are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Broadband white noise:} This type of noise has a constant power density across a wide frequency range. It can mask weaker signals, making it difficult to discern the desired communication.
    
    \item \textbf{Ignition noise:} This noise is generated by internal combustion engines, particularly ignition systems. It can introduce disturbances that affect radio reception, especially in automotive applications.
    
    \item \textbf{Power line noise:} Also known as 60 Hz noise in North America (or 50 Hz in other regions), this noise is produced by electrical equipment and can interfere with sensitive electronic devices.
\end{itemize}

Digital noise reduction techniques utilize algorithms to filter out unwanted noise from the desired signal. These techniques analyze the digital representation of the audio or communication signal and apply various filtering methods to suppress noise components.

\subsubsection{Calculations and Examples}

For understanding how digital noise reduction can be applied, consider a signal that is represented in the frequency domain:
\[
S(f) = A(f) + N(f)
\]
where \( S(f) \) is the received signal, \( A(f) \) is the actual signal, and \( N(f) \) represents noise. 

Digital noise reduction algorithms typically involve:
1. Estimating the noise profile,
2. Applying a threshold to differentiate between signal and noise,
3. Filtering out the estimated noise from the received signal.

For instance, if the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) is represented as:
\[
\text{SNR} = \frac{P_A}{P_N}
\]
where \( P_A \) is the power of the actual signal and \( P_N \) is the power of the noise, managing to increase the SNR via digital filtering methods leads to clearer communication.

% \subsubsection{Diagram Illustration}

% The following TikZ diagram illustrates the relationships between the actual signal, noise sources, and the processed output after digital noise reduction:

% \begin{center}
% \begin{tikzpicture}
%     % Draw the boxes
%     \node (signal) [draw, rectangle, minimum width=2.5cm, minimum height=1cm] {Actual Signal $A(f)$};
%     \node (noise) [draw, rectangle, right=2cm of signal, minimum width=2.5cm, minimum height=1cm] {Noise $N(f)$};
%     \node (combined) [draw, rectangle, below=1.5cm of $(signal)!0.5!(noise)$, minimum width=2.5cm, minimum height=1cm] {Received Signal $S(f)$};
%     \node (output) [draw, rectangle, below=1.5cm of combined, minimum width=2.5cm, minimum height=1cm] {Processed Output};

%     % Draw arrows
%     \draw[->] (signal) -- (combined);
%     \draw[->] (noise) -- (combined);
%     \draw[->] (combined) -- (output);
