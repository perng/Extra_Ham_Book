\subsubsection{Elaboration on Related Concepts}

A Yagi-Uda antenna, commonly referred to as a Yagi antenna, is a directional antenna consisting of multiple elements. The design includes a driven element, a reflector, and one or more parasitic elements, which can be either directors or reflectors. The lengths of these parasitic elements can be adjusted to optimize the performance of the antenna by manipulating the phase of the electromagnetic waves they re-radiate.

When adjusting the lengths of the parasitic elements, the primary goal is to control the phase shift of the signals produced by these elements. In essence, this adjustment allows the antenna to improve its gain and directivity. By making the elements longer than their resonant length, they will behave as if they have a lower resonant frequency, effectively delaying the phase of the signal they re-radiate. Conversely, shortening the elements will increase their resonant frequency and advance the phase of the re-radiated signal.

To better illustrate this concept, we can consider the phase relationship between the driven element and a parasitic element:

\begin{align*}
\text{Phase Shift} = \frac{360^\circ \times f \times L}{c} 
\end{align*}

Where:
- \( f \) is the frequency of operation (in Hz),
- \( L \) is the length of the element (in meters),
- \( c \) is the speed of light in vacuum (\( \approx 3 \times 10^8 \) m/s).

This phase shift is critical for creating constructive interference in the desired direction of the radiation pattern and destructive interference in other directions. This concept becomes particularly relevant when optimizing the antenna's directivity and gain.

This graphic illustrates how adjusting the length of the parasitic elements can affect the phase relationship, and thereby the field strength of the radiation pattern in relation to the driven element. With correct adjustments, the antenna can be optimized for better directivity, making it a powerful tool for radio communication.
