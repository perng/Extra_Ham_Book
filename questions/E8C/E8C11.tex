What is the relationship between symbol rate and baud?
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
    \item They are the same
    \item Baud is twice the symbol rate
    \item Baud rate is half the symbol rate
    \item The relationship depends on the specific code used
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
The question is asking about two important terms in the world of communication: symbol rate and baud. Imagine that you are sending messages using different colored beads on a string. Each color represents a different symbol. The symbol rate is like counting how many beads you put on the string in one second. 

Baud, on the other hand, is also about counting, but it tells us about the number of signal changes or how many times the states of those beads change in one second. If you only use one color, the symbol rate and baud are the same because thereâ€™s no change, but if you use colors that can represent different messages, then one change might mean something different.

So, in simple terms, if you are only sending one bead per second with no changes, then the symbol rate and baud will be the same. But if you are changing colors quickly to send different messages, the relationship might be different.

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
In communication theory, the symbol rate (often measured in symbols per second) refers to the number of distinct symbols transmitted in a given time interval. Baud rate, on the other hand, specifically refers to the number of signal units transmitted per second. 

The relationship between symbol rate and baud can be expressed as:
\[
\text{Baud} = \frac{\text{Symbol Rate}}{R}
\]
where \( R \) is the number of bits represented by each symbol. 

For instance, if a communication system uses a signaling scheme where each symbol represents 2 bits (for example, using four distinct signals: 00, 01, 10, 11), then the baud rate would be half the symbol rate. Conversely, if each symbol only represents one bit, then the symbol rate and baud rate are equal.

To further illustrate, consider:
- If the symbol rate is 1000 symbols per second with each symbol representing 1 bit, then the baud rate is also 1000 baud.
- If the symbol rate remains 1000 symbols per second but each symbol represents 2 bits, then the baud rate would be:
\[
\text{Baud} = \frac{1000 \text{ symbols/sec}}{2} = 500 \text{ baud}
\]

Thus, the correct answer to the question is (A) They are the same, which holds true when we assume that each symbol represents a single bit.
