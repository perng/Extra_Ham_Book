\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10, colframe=black, title={\textbf{Question ID: E8C13}}]
What is described by the constellation diagram of a QAM or QPSK signal?
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
    \item How many carriers may be present at the same time
    \item \textbf{The possible phase and amplitude states for each symbol}
    \item Frequency response of the signal stream
    \item The number of bits used for error correction in the protocol
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
A constellation diagram is like a map that helps us understand how information is transmitted using signals. When we talk about QAM (Quadrature Amplitude Modulation) or QPSK (Quadrature Phase Shift Keying), these are different ways of sending information through electronic signals. 

Imagine each point on this map represents a unique symbol made up of various combinations of signal strength (amplitude) and direction (phase). The diagram shows us all the possible clues (states) we can use to send messages. So, when we look at a constellation diagram, we are actually seeing all the different ways we can represent or encode information in the form of signals!

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
The constellation diagram visually represents the set of possible states for a communication signal encoded through modulation techniques such as QAM and QPSK. Each symbol in these modulation schemes is represented as a unique point in the diagram, where the axes typically represent the in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) components of the signal.

For example, in QPSK, we have four key states represented as points on the constellation diagram, which correspond to the different combinations of phase shifts (0, 90, 180, and 270 degrees) and a constant amplitude. In QAM, especially higher-order (like 16-QAM or 64-QAM), the constellation can represent a greater number of symbols by varying both amplitude and phase, thus providing a more significant amount of data transmission within the same bandwidth.

The relationship between these states depends on several key concepts:
1. **Modulation**: The process of varying one or more characteristics of a carrier signal in accordance with the information signal.
2. **Amplitude**: The strength or height of the signal, which can determine how far the signal can travel.
3. **Phase**: The position of the start of the wave (in degrees), which helps differentiate between different symbols.

To understand this mathematically, consider a QAM constellation that may have 'M' points. Each point can be represented as:
\[
s_k = a_k \cos(\theta_k) + j b_k \sin(\theta_k) \quad \text{for } k = 0, 1, \ldots, M-1
\]
where \( s_k \) represents the complex signal point, \( a_k \) and \( b_k \) represent the amplitude components, and \( \theta_k \) denotes the phase.

The precise selection of these points allows us to encode multiple bits of information into each transmitted symbol, making modulation schemes like QAM and QPSK efficient for communication systems.
