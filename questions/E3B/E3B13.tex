\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you are throwing a ball straight up into the air. The ball moves up and down in a straight line, which is similar to vertical polarization. In ground-wave propagation, the radio waves travel along the surface of the Earth, and they do this best when they are moving up and down, just like the ball. This is why vertical polarization is supported by ground-wave propagation.

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
Ground-wave propagation refers to the transmission of radio waves that follow the curvature of the Earth. This type of propagation is most effective at lower frequencies, typically below 3 MHz. The polarization of a wave refers to the orientation of the electric field vector of the wave.

In ground-wave propagation, vertical polarization is preferred because the Earth's surface acts as a conductor, and vertically polarized waves interact more efficiently with the ground. The electric field of a vertically polarized wave is perpendicular to the Earth's surface, which minimizes the loss of signal strength as the wave travels along the ground.

Mathematically, the electric field \( \mathbf{E} \) of a vertically polarized wave can be represented as:
\[
\mathbf{E} = E_0 \hat{z} \cos(\omega t - kz)
\]
where \( E_0 \) is the amplitude of the electric field, \( \omega \) is the angular frequency, \( t \) is time, \( k \) is the wave number, and \( \hat{z} \) is the unit vector in the vertical direction.

Horizontal polarization, on the other hand, would have the electric field parallel to the Earth's surface, leading to greater signal attenuation due to the interaction with the ground. Circular and elliptical polarizations are more complex and are not typically used in ground-wave propagation because they do not align well with the Earth's conductive surface.

In summary, vertical polarization is the most effective for ground-wave propagation due to its alignment with the Earth's surface, minimizing signal loss and maximizing the range of communication.
