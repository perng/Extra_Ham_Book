\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=E7F02] What kind of digital signal processing audio filter is used to remove unwanted noise from a received SSB signal?
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*]
        \item \textbf{An adaptive filter}
        \item A crystal-lattice filter
        \item A Hilbert-transform filter
        \item A phase-inverting filter

\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you are trying to listen to a friend talking in a noisy room. The noise makes it hard to hear what they are saying. To make it easier, you could use a special tool that listens to the noise and then removes it from the sound you hear. This is similar to what an adaptive filter does for a Single Sideband (SSB) signal. It listens to the unwanted noise and then removes it, making the signal clearer and easier to understand.

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
In digital signal processing, an adaptive filter is a system that adjusts its parameters automatically to minimize the error between the desired signal and the output signal. For SSB signals, which are a type of amplitude modulation (AM) signal, noise can be a significant issue. An adaptive filter works by continuously updating its filter coefficients based on the input signal, effectively canceling out the noise components.

Mathematically, the adaptive filter can be represented as:
\[ y(n) = \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} w_k(n) x(n-k) \]
where \( y(n) \) is the output signal, \( w_k(n) \) are the filter coefficients at time \( n \), and \( x(n-k) \) is the input signal at time \( n-k \). The coefficients \( w_k(n) \) are updated using an algorithm such as the Least Mean Squares (LMS) algorithm:
\[ w_k(n+1) = w_k(n) + \mu e(n) x(n-k) \]
where \( \mu \) is the step size, and \( e(n) \) is the error signal.

The adaptive filter is particularly effective in removing noise from SSB signals because it can dynamically adjust to the changing characteristics of the noise, providing a clearer and more intelligible signal.
