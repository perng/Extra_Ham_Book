\subsection{Secrets in the Air: Who Can Send Encrypted Messages?}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=\textbf{E1D02}]
Which of the following may transmit encrypted messages?
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
    \item Telecommand signals to terrestrial repeaters
    \item \textbf{Telecommand signals from a space telecommand station}
    \item Auxiliary relay links carrying repeater audio
    \item Mesh network backbone nodes
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you have a secret message that you want to send to someone, but you don't want anyone else to understand it. You would use a special code to make the message unreadable to others. In the world of radio communication, certain types of messages can be sent in this secret code, or encrypted. The question is asking which of the given options is allowed to send these secret messages. The correct answer is that telecommand signals from a space telecommand station can send encrypted messages. This is because space stations often need to send important commands that should not be understood by unauthorized people.

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
In radio communication, encryption is the process of encoding messages in such a way that only authorized parties can decode and read them. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and other regulatory bodies have specific rules about which types of transmissions can be encrypted. 

According to FCC regulations, telecommand signals from a space telecommand station (Option B) are permitted to be encrypted. This is because these signals are often used to control satellites or other space-based assets, and it is crucial to ensure that these commands are secure and cannot be intercepted or tampered with by unauthorized entities.

On the other hand, telecommand signals to terrestrial repeaters (Option A), auxiliary relay links carrying repeater audio (Option C), and mesh network backbone nodes (Option D) are generally not allowed to be encrypted. This is because these types of transmissions are typically used for public or shared communication, and encryption could interfere with the ability of other users to access and utilize these services.

In summary, the correct answer is \textbf{B}, as telecommand signals from a space telecommand station are the only option that is permitted to transmit encrypted messages under current regulations.
