\textbf{E1D09} Which UHF amateur bands have frequencies authorized for space stations?

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*]
    \item 70 centimeters only
    \item \textbf{70 centimeters and 13 centimeters}
    \item 70 centimeters and 33 centimeters
    \item 33 centimeters and 13 centimeters
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you have a walkie-talkie that can talk to astronauts in space. But not all walkie-talkies can do this; they need to use special frequencies. In the UHF (Ultra High Frequency) range, there are specific bands that are allowed for space communication. These bands are like special channels that space stations and Earth can use to talk to each other. The correct answer tells us which of these special channels are allowed for space stations.

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
In the context of amateur radio, the UHF spectrum is divided into several bands, each with specific frequency ranges allocated for different purposes. For space stations, the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and national regulatory bodies authorize specific UHF bands for communication. 

The 70-centimeter band (420-450 MHz) and the 13-centimeter band (2.3-2.45 GHz) are both authorized for space station operations. These bands are chosen because they offer a good balance between signal penetration and bandwidth, making them suitable for long-distance communication with satellites and other space stations.

To understand why these bands are selected, consider the following:

1. **70-centimeter band (420-450 MHz):** This band is widely used for amateur satellite communication due to its relatively low frequency, which allows for better signal propagation through the atmosphere and less susceptibility to rain fade compared to higher frequencies.

2. **13-centimeter band (2.3-2.45 GHz):** This band is also authorized for space stations and is used for more specialized applications. The higher frequency allows for greater bandwidth, which is useful for data-intensive communications.

The other options, such as the 33-centimeter band, are not typically authorized for space station use, making them incorrect choices.
