\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black]
    \textbf{E9B11} What is a disadvantage of decreasing the number of wire segments in an antenna model below 10 segments per half-wavelength?
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*)]
        \item Ground conductivity will not be accurately modeled
        \item The resulting design will favor radiation of harmonic energy
        \item \textbf{The computed feed point impedance may be incorrect}
        \item The antenna will become mechanically unstable
    \end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you're trying to draw a smooth curve, but instead of using lots of tiny dots, you use just a few big dots. The curve won't look very smooth, right? The same thing happens with an antenna when you use fewer wire segments. The antenna model becomes less accurate, especially when it comes to figuring out how much power it needs to work properly (that's the feed point impedance). So, if you skimp on the segments, you might end up with an antenna that doesn't work as well as you thought it would!

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
When modeling an antenna, the wire is typically divided into segments to approximate the current distribution along the wire. The number of segments per half-wavelength is crucial for accuracy. A common rule of thumb is to use at least 10 segments per half-wavelength. 

If the number of segments is reduced below this threshold, the model's ability to accurately represent the current distribution diminishes. This inaccuracy directly affects the computed feed point impedance, which is a critical parameter for matching the antenna to the transmission line. The feed point impedance \( Z_{\text{feed}} \) is given by:

\[
Z_{\text{feed}} = \frac{V_{\text{feed}}}{I_{\text{feed}}}
\]

where \( V_{\text{feed}} \) is the voltage and \( I_{\text{feed}} \) is the current at the feed point. Inaccurate modeling of the current distribution leads to errors in \( I_{\text{feed}} \), thus affecting \( Z_{\text{feed}} \).

Additionally, fewer segments can lead to inaccuracies in the radiation pattern and efficiency of the antenna. However, the primary disadvantage in this context is the incorrect computation of the feed point impedance, which can lead to mismatches and reduced performance.
