        \item It is at a minimum
        \item \textbf{It is at a maximum}
        \item It equals 1 divided by the quantity 2 times pi, times the square root of (inductance L multiplied by capacitance C)
        \item It equals 2 times pi, times the square root of (inductance L multiplied by capacitance C)

\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine a parallel LC circuit as a playground swing. At resonance, the swing reaches its highest point, meaning the energy is at its peak. Similarly, in a parallel LC circuit at resonance, the circulating current between the inductor and capacitor is at its maximum. This is because the energy is efficiently transferring back and forth between the two components without any loss.

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
In a parallel LC circuit at resonance, the impedance of the circuit is at its maximum, and the current from the source is at its minimum. However, the circulating current within the LC components is at its maximum. This is due to the fact that the inductive reactance (\(X_L\)) and capacitive reactance (\(X_C\)) are equal and cancel each other out, leading to a condition where the energy oscillates between the magnetic field of the inductor and the electric field of the capacitor.

The resonant frequency (\(f_0\)) of the LC circuit is given by:
\[
f_0 = \frac{1}{2\pi\sqrt{LC}}
\]
At this frequency, the impedance (\(Z\)) of the parallel LC circuit is:
\[
Z = \frac{X_L X_C}{X_L + X_C}
\]
Since \(X_L = X_C\) at resonance, the impedance becomes very high, minimizing the current from the source. However, the circulating current (\(I_{circ}\)) within the LC components is:
\[
I_{circ} = \frac{V}{X_L} = \frac{V}{X_C}
\]
where \(V\) is the voltage across the components. Since \(X_L\) and \(X_C\) are at their minimum values at resonance, \(I_{circ}\) is at its maximum.
