\textbf{What is the maximum permissible duration of a remotely controlled stationâ€™s transmissions if its control link malfunctions?}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*)]
    \item 30 seconds
    \item \textbf{3 minutes}
    \item 5 minutes
    \item 10 minutes
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you have a remote-controlled car, and suddenly the remote stops working. If the car keeps moving, it could cause problems, right? Similarly, in radio technology, if the control link for a remotely controlled station stops working, the station can only keep transmitting for a short time to avoid causing interference or other issues. The rules say that the station can only transmit for up to 3 minutes if the control link fails. This gives enough time to fix the problem without causing too much trouble.

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
In the context of radio communications, a remotely controlled station relies on a control link to manage its operations. If this control link malfunctions, the station must cease transmissions within a specified time to prevent uncontrolled or prolonged interference with other communications. According to regulatory standards, the maximum permissible duration for such transmissions is 3 minutes. This limit is set to balance the need for operational continuity with the necessity to minimize potential disruptions.

Mathematically, this can be represented as:
\[
\text{Max Transmission Duration} = 3 \text{ minutes}
\]
This duration is chosen based on empirical data and regulatory considerations to ensure that any malfunction does not lead to significant interference or safety hazards.

Related concepts include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Control Link}: The communication channel used to remotely operate the station.
    \item \textbf{Interference}: Unwanted disruption of signals caused by overlapping transmissions.
    \item \textbf{Regulatory Compliance}: Adherence to rules and standards set by governing bodies to ensure safe and efficient use of the radio spectrum.
\end{itemize}
