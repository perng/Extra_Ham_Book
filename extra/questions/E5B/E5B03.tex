\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you have a special kind of resistance called impedance, which is like a combination of regular resistance and something called reactance. Now, admittance is just the opposite of impedanceâ€”it tells you how easily electricity can flow through a circuit. To change impedance into admittance, you flip the size (take the reciprocal) and reverse the direction (change the sign of the angle). It's like turning a big, hard-to-push boulder into a small, easy-to-roll pebble!

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
Impedance \( Z \) in polar form is represented as:
\[
Z = |Z| \angle \theta
\]
where \( |Z| \) is the magnitude and \( \theta \) is the phase angle. Admittance \( Y \) is the reciprocal of impedance:
\[
Y = \frac{1}{Z}
\]
To convert impedance to admittance in polar form, follow these steps:
1. Take the reciprocal of the magnitude:
\[
|Y| = \frac{1}{|Z|}
\]
2. Change the sign of the angle:
\[
\theta_Y = -\theta
\]
Thus, the admittance in polar form is:
\[
Y = |Y| \angle \theta_Y = \frac{1}{|Z|} \angle -\theta
\]
This conversion is essential in analyzing AC circuits, where impedance and admittance are used to describe the opposition and ease of current flow, respectively.
