    \textbf{E9A01} What is an isotropic radiator?
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*,noitemsep]
        \item A calibrated, unidirectional antenna used to make precise antenna gain measurements
        \item An omnidirectional, horizontally polarized, precisely calibrated antenna used to make field measurements of antenna gain
        \item \textbf{A hypothetical, lossless antenna having equal radiation intensity in all directions used as a reference for antenna gain}
        \item A spacecraft antenna used to direct signals toward Earth
    \end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you have a magical light bulb that shines equally bright in every direction—up, down, left, right, and all around. No matter where you stand, the light looks the same. That's what an isotropic radiator is like, but instead of light, it's radio waves! It's a pretend antenna that sends out signals equally in all directions. Scientists use this pretend antenna as a reference to compare how well real antennas work. So, if someone says an antenna is twice as good as an isotropic radiator, it means it sends out signals twice as strong in a certain direction.

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
An isotropic radiator is a theoretical concept used in antenna theory to describe a point source that radiates electromagnetic waves uniformly in all directions. It is considered lossless, meaning it does not dissipate any energy as heat or other forms of energy. The radiation intensity \( U \) of an isotropic radiator is the same in all directions, and it is given by:

\[
U = \frac{P_{\text{rad}}}{4\pi r^2}
\]

where \( P_{\text{rad}} \) is the total radiated power and \( r \) is the distance from the radiator. This uniform radiation pattern makes the isotropic radiator a useful reference for comparing the gain of real antennas. The gain \( G \) of an antenna is often expressed in decibels relative to an isotropic radiator (dBi):

\[
G_{\text{dBi}} = 10 \log_{10} \left( \frac{G}{G_{\text{isotropic}}} \right)
\]

where \( G_{\text{isotropic}} \) is the gain of the isotropic radiator, which is 1 by definition. Real antennas, such as dipoles or parabolic dishes, do not radiate equally in all directions and thus have gains greater than 1 in certain directions.
