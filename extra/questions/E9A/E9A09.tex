\textbf{What is antenna efficiency?}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*)]
    \item Radiation resistance divided by transmission resistance
    \item \textbf{Radiation resistance divided by total resistance}
    \item Total resistance divided by radiation resistance
    \item Effective radiated power divided by transmitter output
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine your antenna is like a superhero. Its job is to send out signals (like a superhero's powers) to save the day! But not all of the energy it gets from the transmitter is used to send out these signals. Some of it gets lost, like when a superhero gets tired. Antenna efficiency is like measuring how much of the superhero's energy is actually used to save the day, compared to how much energy is wasted. So, it's the ratio of the energy that actually goes out as signals (radiation resistance) to the total energy the antenna gets (total resistance). The higher this ratio, the more efficient your antenna is!

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
Antenna efficiency (\(\eta\)) is a measure of how effectively an antenna converts the input power into radiated power. It is defined as the ratio of the radiation resistance (\(R_r\)) to the total resistance (\(R_t\)) of the antenna. The total resistance includes both the radiation resistance and the loss resistance (\(R_l\)), which accounts for the power lost in the antenna due to factors like ohmic losses.

Mathematically, antenna efficiency is given by:
\[
\eta = \frac{R_r}{R_t} = \frac{R_r}{R_r + R_l}
\]

Where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(R_r\) is the radiation resistance, which represents the power radiated by the antenna.
    \item \(R_l\) is the loss resistance, which represents the power lost in the antenna.
    \item \(R_t = R_r + R_l\) is the total resistance of the antenna.
\end{itemize}

For example, if an antenna has a radiation resistance of \(50\ \Omega\) and a loss resistance of \(10\ \Omega\), the total resistance is \(60\ \Omega\). The antenna efficiency would then be:
\[
\eta = \frac{50}{50 + 10} = \frac{50}{60} \approx 0.833 \text{ or } 83.3\%
\]

This means that 83.3\% of the input power is effectively radiated by the antenna, while the remaining 16.7\% is lost as heat or other forms of energy.

\subsubsection{Related Concepts}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Radiation Resistance (\(R_r\))}: This is the resistance that represents the power radiated by the antenna. It is a hypothetical resistance that, if it were the only resistance in the antenna, would dissipate the same amount of power as the antenna radiates.
    \item \textbf{Loss Resistance (\(R_l\))}: This is the resistance that accounts for the power lost in the antenna due to factors like ohmic losses in the conductors, dielectric losses, and other inefficiencies.
    \item \textbf{Total Resistance (\(R_t\))}: This is the sum of the radiation resistance and the loss resistance. It represents the total resistance encountered by the current flowing through the antenna.
