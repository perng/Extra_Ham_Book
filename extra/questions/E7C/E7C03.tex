    \begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*),noitemsep]
        \item \textbf{Greater harmonic suppression}
        \item Higher efficiency
        \item To eliminate one capacitor

\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you have a water filter that removes dirt from water. Now, if you add an extra layer to the filter, it can catch even smaller particles, making the water cleaner. Similarly, in a Pi-network, adding an inductor (like an extra layer) helps to filter out unwanted signals, called harmonics, more effectively. This makes the signal cleaner and reduces interference.

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
A Pi-network is a type of filter circuit used in radio frequency (RF) applications to match impedance and filter out unwanted frequencies. It typically consists of two capacitors and one inductor arranged in a Pi shape. When an additional inductor is added to create a Pi-L-network, the circuit's ability to suppress harmonics (unwanted frequencies that are multiples of the fundamental frequency) is enhanced.

The inductor in the Pi-L-network introduces additional impedance at harmonic frequencies, effectively attenuating them. This is particularly useful in RF amplifiers where harmonic suppression is crucial to prevent interference with other signals. The mathematical relationship can be described using the impedance formula for an inductor:

\[
Z_L = j\omega L
\]

where \( Z_L \) is the impedance of the inductor, \( j \) is the imaginary unit, \( \omega \) is the angular frequency, and \( L \) is the inductance. At higher frequencies (harmonics), the impedance increases, leading to greater suppression of these frequencies.

In summary, the addition of an inductor to a Pi-network to form a Pi-L-network significantly improves harmonic suppression, making it a valuable modification in RF circuit design.
