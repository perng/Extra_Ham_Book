\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing, or OFDM, is a way to send lots of information over a wireless signal, like how we listen to music on the radio or stream videos online. Imagine you are trying to talk to your friend in a crowded room. If everyone speaks at the same time, it's really hard to understand. Now, think about if you and your friend decided to use different channels or frequencies to talk, where each of you has a special frequency that no one else uses. This makes it easier to hear each other because you are not interfering with what others are saying. OFDM is similar; it uses many small signals at different frequencies, so they donâ€™t mess up each other, which helps to deliver clear information over the air.

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) is a digital modulation technique that divides a large bandwidth into many smaller subcarriers. These subcarriers are spaced closely in frequency but remain orthogonal to each other, meaning that the peak of one subcarrier coincides with the nulls of others, allowing them to overlap without interfering with one another.

The mathematical basis of OFDM lies in the use of Fourier transforms, specifically the Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform (IDFT) and its counterpart, the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). In the case of OFDM:

1. The input data symbols are modulated onto multiple subcarriers.
2. An IDFT is applied to convert the frequency domain representation into the time domain.
3. The resulting signal can be transmitted over a communication channel.

To understand why OFDM is effective, it is important to analyze intersymbol interference (ISI) which occurs when symbols interfere with each other, making it challenging to decode the received signal correctly. By choosing subcarrier frequencies based on their orthogonality, OFDM minimizes the chances of ISI.

For a more comprehensive understanding, consider the following steps in the process of signal creation in OFDM:

- Let $X[k]$ denote the data symbols for the k-th subcarrier.
- The IDFT is then calculated as:

$$ x[n] = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} X[k] e^{j \frac{2 \pi}{N} k n} $$

where:
- $N$ is the total number of subcarriers,
- $x[n]$ is the time domain signal,
- $n$ is the index in the time domain.

Due to the orthogonality property, the subcarriers at frequencies $f_k = k\Delta f$ (where $\Delta f$ is the frequency spacing) can be simultaneously transmitted without interference, making OFDM robust against many common issues in wireless communication systems, such as multipath fading.
