\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10, colframe=black, title={Question \textbf{E8B07}}]
    Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) is a technique used for which types of amateur communication?
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*,noitemsep]
        \item \textbf{Digital modes}
        \item Extremely low-power contacts
        \item EME
        \item OFDM signals are not allowed on amateur bands
    \end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing, or OFDM, is like distributing your toys across several tables during a playdate so that everyone can enjoy them without bumping into each other. Similarly, in communication, OFDM helps send many signals at once, making sure they do not interfere with one another. In amateur radio, it allows us to send signals clearly and effectively. One of the best uses of OFDM is in digital modes, where we can send text, pictures, or data over the air. 

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) is a method of encoding digital data on multiple carrier frequencies. It has become a popular technique in various communication systems, including amateur radio. 

In amateur communications, OFDM is primarily utilized for digital modes. These modes involve the transmission of digital data—such as text, images, and more—over radio waves. The advantage of OFDM is that it divides a large bandwidth into smaller sub-channels, which minimizes interference and allows for the efficient use of the frequency spectrum.

To illustrate the power of OFDM in amateur communication, consider the following steps in a digital data transmission:
1. The user selects the digital mode of communication.
2. The digital information is encoded into bits.
3. These bits are mapped onto sub-carriers of the OFDM signal.
4. Each sub-carrier transmits the information simultaneously.

This technique can efficiently handle multipath propagation—where signals arrive at the receiver from various paths and times—by implementing error correction methods.

In conclusion, while there may be constraints like extremely low-power contacts and EME (Earth-Moon-Earth communications), the most prevalent application of OFDM remains in digital modes where it enhances communication effectiveness and clarity.
