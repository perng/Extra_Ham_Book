    \begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*,noitemsep]
        \item Series RLC in parallel with a shunt C representing electrode and stray capacitance
        \item Parallel RLC, where C is the parallel combination of resonance capacitance of the crystal and electrode and stray capacitance
        \item Series RLC, where C is the parallel combination of resonance capacitance of the crystal and electrode and stray capacitance
        \item Parallel RLC, where C is the series combination of resonance capacitance of the crystal and electrode and stray capacitance
    \end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine a quartz crystal as a tiny tuning fork that vibrates at a specific frequency when you tap it. In electronics, we can represent this behavior using a simple circuit. The quartz crystal acts like a combination of a resistor (R), an inductor (L), and a capacitor (C) connected in series. Additionally, thereâ€™s another capacitor (shunt C) that represents the extra capacitance from the electrodes and the surrounding environment. This shunt capacitor is connected in parallel to the series RLC circuit. So, the equivalent circuit of a quartz crystal is a series RLC circuit in parallel with a shunt capacitor.

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
The equivalent circuit of a quartz crystal is derived from its mechanical and electrical properties. The crystal exhibits a series resonance due to its mechanical vibrations, which can be modeled as a series RLC circuit. The components are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( R \): Represents the energy losses in the crystal.
    \item \( L \): Represents the mass of the crystal.
    \item \( C \): Represents the elasticity of the crystal.
\end{itemize}

In addition to the series RLC circuit, there is a shunt capacitance \( C_0 \) that accounts for the electrode capacitance and stray capacitance. This shunt capacitance is connected in parallel to the series RLC circuit. The equivalent circuit can be expressed as:

\[
Z_{\text{total}} = \frac{1}{j\omega C_0} \parallel \left( R + j\omega L + \frac{1}{j\omega C} \right)
\]

Where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( Z_{\text{total}} \) is the total impedance of the circuit.
    \item \( \omega \) is the angular frequency.
    \item \( C_0 \) is the shunt capacitance.
\end{itemize}

This configuration allows the quartz crystal to exhibit both series and parallel resonance frequencies, making it a versatile component in oscillators and filters.
