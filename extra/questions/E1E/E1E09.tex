\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you are playing a game where you are supposed to follow the rules. If someone cheats in the game, they might get kicked out or not allowed to play for a while. Similarly, if a Volunteer Examiner (VE) cheats by fraudulently administering or certifying an amateur radio exam, they could lose their license to operate their radio station and might not be allowed to take part in amateur radio activities for some time. This is a serious consequence to make sure everyone plays fair and follows the rules.

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
In the context of amateur radio licensing, a Volunteer Examiner (VE) is responsible for administering and certifying examinations for amateur radio licenses. Fraudulent administration or certification of these exams undermines the integrity of the licensing process. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) enforces strict penalties to deter such misconduct. 

The correct answer, \textbf{A}, indicates that the VE’s amateur station license grant may be revoked, and the VE’s amateur operator license grant may be suspended. This means the VE would lose the authorization to operate their amateur radio station and may be temporarily barred from holding an amateur operator license. 

While options B and C mention fines and imprisonment, these are not the primary penalties for this specific violation. Option D is incorrect because not all the listed penalties apply in this scenario. The FCC’s regulations are designed to ensure the integrity of the amateur radio licensing process, and penalties are tailored to address specific violations.
