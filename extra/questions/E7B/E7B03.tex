\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you have a radio that sends out signals. These signals are like waves in the ocean, but sometimes they have extra waves (called harmonics) that we don’t want. An RF switching amplifier is like a machine that makes these waves stronger. But after the waves are made stronger, we need to clean them up by removing the extra waves we don’t want. This is done using a special tool called a filter. So, the correct answer is to use a filter to remove the extra waves (harmonic content).

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
An RF switching amplifier operates by rapidly switching the output between on and off states, which inherently generates harmonic content due to the abrupt transitions. These harmonics can interfere with other signals and degrade the performance of the RF system. To mitigate this, a low-pass filter is typically employed at the output of the amplifier. This filter attenuates the higher frequency harmonics while allowing the desired fundamental frequency to pass through with minimal loss.

Mathematically, the output of an RF switching amplifier can be represented as a square wave, which in the frequency domain consists of the fundamental frequency and its odd harmonics. The Fourier series representation of a square wave is given by:

\[
V(t) = \frac{4V_{pp}}{\pi} \left( \sin(\omega t) + \frac{1}{3}\sin(3\omega t) + \frac{1}{5}\sin(5\omega t) + \dots \right)
\]

where \( V_{pp} \) is the peak-to-peak voltage and \( \omega \) is the angular frequency of the fundamental component. The low-pass filter is designed to attenuate the higher-order terms (3$\Omega$, 5$\Omega$, etc.) while preserving the fundamental component ($\Omega$).

The design of the filter involves selecting appropriate components (inductors and capacitors) to achieve the desired cutoff frequency, which is typically just above the fundamental frequency of the signal. This ensures that the harmonics are sufficiently attenuated without significantly affecting the desired signal.
