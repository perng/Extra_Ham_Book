\subsubsection*{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you have a water pipe with a valve that controls how much water can flow through it. If the valve is very easy to open, it means the pipe doesn't resist the water flow much. Similarly, a grounded-grid amplifier is like a pipe with an easy-to-open valveâ€”it doesn't resist the electrical signal much, which is why it has a low input impedance. This makes it easier for the signal to pass through without much resistance.

\subsubsection*{Advanced Explanation}
A grounded-grid amplifier is a type of vacuum tube amplifier where the grid is connected to ground. This configuration results in a low input impedance because the grid is at ground potential, and the input signal is applied to the cathode. The low input impedance is due to the fact that the grid is effectively shielding the input signal from the output circuit, reducing the impedance seen at the input.

Mathematically, the input impedance \( Z_{in} \) of a grounded-grid amplifier can be approximated by:
\[
Z_{in} \approx \frac{1}{g_m}
\]
where \( g_m \) is the transconductance of the tube. Since \( g_m \) is typically high for vacuum tubes, \( Z_{in} \) is low.

This low input impedance is beneficial in certain applications, such as RF amplifiers, where it allows for efficient signal transfer and reduces the likelihood of signal reflection. Additionally, the grounded-grid configuration provides good linearity and stability, making it suitable for high-frequency applications.
