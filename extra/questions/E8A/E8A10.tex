\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you have a toy that can play music, but sometimes it makes strange noises when you press the buttons too quickly. A low-pass filter is like a magic tool that helps smooth out those strange noises so that you only hear the nice music. In the case of a digital-to-analog converter (DAC), it helps to make the signal cleaner, getting rid of unwanted noises so that you can enjoy a better sound. It’s all about making sure what you hear is clear and pleasant!

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
A digital-to-analog converter (DAC) converts digital signals (discrete values represented in binary) into analog signals (continuous waveforms). However, during this process, particularly in high-speed conversions, spurious artifacts can arise known as aliasing. These artifacts occur when the sampling rate is not sufficiently high to accurately represent the original signal, leading to distortions. 

A low-pass filter (LPF) is applied at the output of a DAC to attenuate (reduce) these undesired high-frequency components. The purpose of the LPF is to limit the bandwidth of the output signal, typically allowing only the frequencies below a certain cutoff frequency to pass through while blocking higher frequencies that are considered noise. 

To illustrate the role of the LPF, consider the following:

- A DAC outputs a series of voltage levels that correspond to digital values.
- The output waveform resembles a staircase rather than a smooth curve due to the discrete nature of the digital input.
- If we visualize this staircase, it contains sharp changes that correspond to the transitions in the digital signal.
- The LPF smooths out this staircase, yielding a continuous waveform by averaging the abrupt changes.

The mathematical representation of the LPF can often be modeled as an RC (resistor-capacitor) circuit with a transfer function: 

\[
H(f) = \frac{1}{1 + j\frac{f}{f_c}}
\]

where \(H(f)\) is the transfer function, \(j\) is the imaginary unit, \(f\) is the frequency of interest, and \(f_c\) is the cutoff frequency of the filter.

Through the design of the filter – specifying parameters like the cutoff frequency and filter order – one can ensure that the most crucial parts of the signal are preserved while spurious artifacts are effectively minimized. 

In conclusion, the primary goal of utilizing a low-pass filter at the output of a DAC is to remove spurious signals and deliver a cleaner analog output that closely replicates the intended input signal.
