        \item The conversion of voltage to current when exposed to light
        \item \textbf{The conversion of light to electrical energy}
        \item The effect that causes a photodiode to emit light when a voltage is applied

\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you have a magical material that can turn sunlight into electricity. When sunlight hits this material, it gets excited and starts producing electricity. This is what the photovoltaic effect is all about! It’s like having a tiny power plant that runs on sunlight instead of coal or gas. Solar panels use this effect to generate electricity for homes, calculators, and even satellites in space.

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
The photovoltaic effect is a physical and chemical phenomenon where certain materials generate an electric current when exposed to light. This occurs due to the interaction of photons (light particles) with the electrons in the material. When a photon with sufficient energy strikes the material, it can excite an electron from the valence band to the conduction band, creating an electron-hole pair. This separation of charges generates a voltage, which can be harnessed as electrical energy.

Mathematically, the energy of a photon \( E \) is given by:
\[
E = h \nu
\]
where \( h \) is Planck’s constant (\( 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J} \cdot \text{s} \)) and \( \nu \) is the frequency of the light. For the photovoltaic effect to occur, the photon energy must be greater than the bandgap energy \( E_g \) of the material:
\[
E > E_g
\]
This ensures that the electron can be excited from the valence band to the conduction band.

The photovoltaic effect is the fundamental principle behind solar cells, which are made of semiconductor materials like silicon. When multiple solar cells are connected in series or parallel, they form a solar panel capable of generating significant electrical power.
