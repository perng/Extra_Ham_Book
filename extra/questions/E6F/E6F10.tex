\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you have a magical box that can turn sunlight into electricity. This box is called a solar panel. Now, what if I told you that the most important part of this box is made from something you might find in sand? That's right! The material used most often in solar panels is silicon. Silicon is special because it can absorb sunlight and turn it into electricity very efficiently. It's like the superhero of materials when it comes to making solar panels!

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
Photovoltaic (PV) cells, commonly known as solar cells, convert sunlight directly into electricity through the photovoltaic effect. The most widely used material in these cells is silicon, specifically in the form of crystalline silicon. Silicon is preferred due to its semiconducting properties, which allow it to efficiently absorb photons from sunlight and generate electron-hole pairs, leading to an electric current.

The process can be summarized as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Photon Absorption}: When sunlight hits the silicon, photons with sufficient energy are absorbed, exciting electrons from the valence band to the conduction band.
    \item \textbf{Electron-Hole Pair Generation}: This excitation creates electron-hole pairs.
    \item \textbf{Charge Separation}: The built-in electric field in the p-n junction of the silicon cell separates the electrons and holes, driving them to opposite sides.
    \item \textbf{Current Generation}: The movement of these charges generates an electric current that can be harnessed for power.
\end{enumerate}

Silicon's abundance, stability, and well-understood manufacturing processes make it the material of choice for most photovoltaic applications. Other materials like selenium, cadmium sulfide, and indium arsenide are used in specialized applications but do not match silicon's widespread adoption and efficiency.
