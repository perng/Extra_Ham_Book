    \textbf{E9E05} What Yagi driven element feed point impedance is required to use a beta or hairpin matching system?
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*)]
        \item \textbf{Capacitive (driven element electrically shorter than 1/2 wavelength)}
        \item Inductive (driven element electrically longer than 1/2 wavelength)
        \item Purely resistive
        \item Purely reactive
    \end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine your Yagi antenna is like a guitar string. If the string is too short, it doesn’t vibrate well, and if it’s too long, it’s floppy and doesn’t make a good sound. The driven element of the Yagi is like that string. For the beta or hairpin matching system to work, the driven element needs to be a bit shorter than half the wavelength of the signal. This makes the feed point impedance capacitive, like a spring that’s ready to bounce back. If it were too long, it would be inductive, like a stretched-out slinky that’s too lazy to bounce back. So, the right length makes it capacitive, and that’s what we need for a perfect match!

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
The feed point impedance of a Yagi driven element is crucial for effective matching. The beta or hairpin matching system is designed to match a capacitive impedance. This occurs when the driven element is electrically shorter than half the wavelength (\(\lambda/2\)). 

The impedance \(Z\) of the driven element can be expressed as:
\[
Z = R + jX
\]
where \(R\) is the resistive component and \(X\) is the reactive component. For the feed point impedance to be capacitive, the reactive component \(X\) must be negative, indicating a capacitive reactance. This is achieved when the driven element is shorter than \(\lambda/2\).

The beta or hairpin matching system works by introducing an inductive reactance to cancel out the capacitive reactance, resulting in a purely resistive impedance at the feed point. This ensures maximum power transfer from the transmitter to the antenna.

In summary, the correct feed point impedance for using a beta or hairpin matching system is capacitive, which is achieved when the driven element is electrically shorter than half the wavelength.
