    \textbf{E9E07} What parameter describes the interaction of a load and transmission line?
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*,noitemsep]
        \item Characteristic impedance
        \item \textbf{Reflection coefficient}
        \item Velocity factor
        \item Dielectric constant
    \end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you're playing a game of catch with a friend. You throw the ball (signal) towards them, but instead of catching it, they throw it back (reflection). The way they throw it back depends on how they interact with the ball. In the world of radio waves, the Reflection Coefficient is like a score that tells you how much of the signal bounces back when it hits the load (your friend). If the load is perfectly matched, it’s like your friend catches the ball perfectly—no reflection! But if there’s a mismatch, some of the signal bounces back, and the Reflection Coefficient tells you how much.

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
The interaction between a load and a transmission line is described by the \textbf{Reflection Coefficient} (\(\Gamma\)). This parameter quantifies the amount of signal reflected back from the load due to impedance mismatch. The Reflection Coefficient is defined as:

\[
\Gamma = \frac{Z_L - Z_0}{Z_L + Z_0}
\]

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(Z_L\) is the impedance of the load,
    \item \(Z_0\) is the characteristic impedance of the transmission line.
\end{itemize}

The magnitude of \(\Gamma\) ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates no reflection (perfect match) and 1 indicates total reflection (complete mismatch). The phase of \(\Gamma\) indicates the phase shift of the reflected wave relative to the incident wave.

\paragraph{Related Concepts:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Characteristic Impedance (\(Z_0\))}: The inherent impedance of the transmission line, which depends on its physical properties.
    \item \textbf{Impedance Matching}: The process of making \(Z_L\) equal to \(Z_0\) to minimize reflections.
    \item \textbf{Standing Wave Ratio (SWR)}: A measure derived from \(\Gamma\) that indicates the efficiency of power transfer from the transmission line to the load.
\end{itemize}
