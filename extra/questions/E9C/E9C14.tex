\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black]
    \textbf{E9C14} How does the radiation pattern of a horizontally-polarized antenna mounted above a long slope compare with the same antenna mounted above flat ground?
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*]
        \item The main lobe takeoff angle increases in the downhill direction
        \item \textbf{The main lobe takeoff angle decreases in the downhill direction}
        \item The horizontal beamwidth decreases in the downhill direction
        \item The horizontal beamwidth increases in the uphill direction
    \end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you're standing on a hill with a flashlight. If you point the flashlight straight ahead on flat ground, the light goes out in a straight line. But if you're on a slope, the angle of the light changes depending on whether you're pointing it uphill or downhill. When you point it downhill, the light seems to drop faster, making the angle of the light beam lower. Similarly, a horizontally-polarized antenna on a slope will have its main lobe (the direction it sends out the most signal) point at a lower angle when it's facing downhill. So, the main lobe takeoff angle decreases in the downhill direction. Easy peasy!

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
The radiation pattern of an antenna is influenced by the ground or surface it is mounted on. When a horizontally-polarized antenna is mounted above a slope, the ground reflection affects the phase and amplitude of the radiated waves. The slope causes the reflected waves to arrive at the antenna at a different angle compared to flat ground. This results in a shift in the main lobe takeoff angle.

Mathematically, the takeoff angle $\theta$ can be approximated using the following relationship:

\[
\theta = \theta_0 - \alpha
\]

where $\theta_0$ is the takeoff angle on flat ground, and $\alpha$ is the slope angle. When the antenna is mounted on a downhill slope, $\alpha$ is positive, leading to a decrease in the takeoff angle $\theta$.

This phenomenon is a result of the constructive and destructive interference patterns created by the direct and reflected waves. The slope alters the path length difference between the direct and reflected waves, thereby changing the interference pattern and the resulting radiation pattern.
