\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=Question E9C06]
\textbf{E9C06} What is the effect of adding a terminating resistor to a rhombic or long-wire antenna?
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*]
    \item It reflects the standing waves on the antenna elements back to the transmitter
    \item \textbf{It changes the radiation pattern from bidirectional to unidirectional}
    \item It changes the radiation pattern from horizontal to vertical polarization
    \item It decreases the ground loss
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you have a super long wire or a fancy rhombic-shaped antenna. Normally, these antennas send signals in two directions, like a two-way street. But what if you want all the signal to go in just one direction, like a one-way street? That's where the terminating resistor comes in! It's like putting a stop sign at one end of the street. The resistor absorbs the signal going in the unwanted direction, making the antenna focus all its energy in one direction. So, instead of sending signals both ways, it becomes a one-way superstar!

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
In antenna theory, a rhombic or long-wire antenna typically exhibits a bidirectional radiation pattern, meaning it radiates energy equally in two opposite directions. This is due to the standing waves formed along the antenna elements. When a terminating resistor is added at the end of the antenna, it serves to absorb the energy that would otherwise be reflected back, effectively eliminating the standing waves.

The terminating resistor matches the characteristic impedance of the antenna, ensuring that the energy is absorbed rather than reflected. This changes the radiation pattern from bidirectional to unidirectional. Mathematically, the power absorbed by the resistor \( P \) can be expressed as:

\[
P = \frac{V^2}{R}
\]

where \( V \) is the voltage across the resistor and \( R \) is the resistance value. By carefully selecting \( R \) to match the antenna's impedance, the resistor ensures maximum power absorption, thus optimizing the antenna's performance for unidirectional radiation.

Related concepts include impedance matching, standing waves, and radiation patterns. Understanding these principles is crucial for designing and optimizing antenna systems for specific applications.
