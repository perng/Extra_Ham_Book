\textbf{E9C12} Which of the following describes an extended double Zepp antenna?
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*,noitemsep]
    \item An end-fed full-wave dipole antenna
    \item A center-fed 1.5-wavelength dipole antenna
    \item \textbf{A center-fed 1.25-wavelength dipole antenna}
    \item An end-fed 2-wavelength dipole antenna
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you have a piece of string that's just the right length to make a big, fancy bow. Now, think of an antenna like that string, but instead of making a bow, it's sending out radio waves. The extended double Zepp antenna is like a special kind of bow that's a bit longer than usual—specifically, 1.25 times the length of a normal bow (or wavelength, in antenna terms). It's also fed in the middle, like tying the bow right at the center. This makes it super efficient at sending and receiving signals, just like a well-tied bow looks perfect!

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
The extended double Zepp antenna is a type of dipole antenna that is center-fed and has a total length of 1.25 wavelengths (\(\lambda\)). This specific length is chosen to optimize the antenna's radiation pattern and impedance matching. 

The antenna's length can be calculated as follows:
\[
\text{Length} = 1.25 \times \lambda
\]
where \(\lambda\) is the wavelength of the operating frequency. The center-fed configuration ensures that the current distribution along the antenna is symmetrical, which enhances its radiation efficiency.

The extended double Zepp antenna is particularly noted for its directional radiation pattern, which makes it suitable for long-distance communication. The 1.25-wavelength design helps in achieving a lower angle of radiation, which is beneficial for skywave propagation.

Related concepts include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Dipole Antenna}: A basic type of antenna consisting of two conductive elements.
    \item \textbf{Wavelength (\(\lambda\))}: The distance between successive crests of a wave.
    \item \textbf{Impedance Matching}: The process of making the impedance of the antenna match the impedance of the transmission line to maximize power transfer.
\end{itemize}
