\textbf{What combines to create the self-resonance of a component?}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
    \item The component’s resistance and reactance

\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you have a swing. When you push the swing at just the right time, it goes higher and higher with each push. This is called resonance. In electronics, components like coils and capacitors can also have a swing effect. The self-resonance of a component happens when the natural swing of the component matches the frequency of the signal passing through it. This is caused by the combination of the component's main properties (like its inductance or capacitance) and the tiny, unintended properties (like parasitic reactance) that come from how it's made.

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
Self-resonance in a component occurs when the component's nominal reactance (the intended reactance due to its design, such as inductance \(L\) or capacitance \(C\)) interacts with its parasitic reactance (unintended reactance due to factors like stray capacitance or inductance). The self-resonant frequency \(f_{\text{SR}}\) can be calculated using the formula:

\[
f_{\text{SR}} = \frac{1}{2\pi\sqrt{L_{\text{eff}} C_{\text{eff}}}}
\]

where \(L_{\text{eff}}\) is the effective inductance and \(C_{\text{eff}}\) is the effective capacitance, which includes both the nominal and parasitic values. At this frequency, the component's impedance becomes purely resistive, and the phase angle between voltage and current is zero. This phenomenon is crucial in designing circuits to avoid unwanted resonances that can distort signals or cause instability.
