\subsubsection*{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you are playing a game of telephone with your friends. If the line of people is very long, the message might get mixed up or delayed by the time it reaches the end. Similarly, at microwave frequencies, signals travel very fast, but if the connection is too long, the signal can get delayed or distorted. Using short connections is like having fewer people in the telephone gameâ€”it helps the signal stay clear and arrive quickly without getting messed up.

\subsubsection*{Advanced Explanation}
At microwave frequencies, the wavelength of the signal is very short, typically in the range of millimeters to centimeters. When the physical length of a connection becomes comparable to the wavelength of the signal, phase shifts can occur. These phase shifts can lead to signal distortion, loss of coherence, and interference. 

The phase shift \(\Delta \phi\) along a transmission line can be expressed as:
\[
\Delta \phi = \beta \cdot l
\]
where \(\beta\) is the phase constant (related to the wavelength \(\lambda\) by \(\beta = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda}\)) and \(l\) is the length of the transmission line. 

By minimizing \(l\), we reduce \(\Delta \phi\), thereby minimizing the phase shift and ensuring that the signal remains coherent and undistorted. This is particularly critical in microwave circuits where precise phase relationships are essential for proper operation.

Additionally, shorter connections reduce the likelihood of impedance mismatches and reflections, which can further degrade signal quality. Thus, short connections are employed to maintain signal integrity and minimize phase-related issues at microwave frequencies.
