    \item The frequency at which the current gain is reduced to 0.707
    \item \textbf{The change in collector current with respect to the change in base current}
    \item The breakdown voltage of the base-to-collector junction
    \item The switching speed

\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you have a water faucet. The amount of water that comes out of the faucet (collector current) depends on how much you turn the handle (base current). The beta of a bipolar junction transistor is like a measure of how sensitive the faucet is to turning the handle. If you turn the handle a little bit and a lot of water comes out, the beta is high. If you have to turn the handle a lot to get a little water, the beta is low. So, beta tells us how much the collector current changes when we change the base current.

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
The beta (\(\beta\)) of a bipolar junction transistor (BJT) is defined as the ratio of the change in collector current (\(\Delta I_C\)) to the change in base current (\(\Delta I_B\)). Mathematically, it is expressed as:

\[
\beta = \frac{\Delta I_C}{\Delta I_B}
\]

This parameter is also known as the current gain of the transistor in the common-emitter configuration. It is a crucial parameter in designing and analyzing transistor circuits because it determines how much the transistor amplifies the input signal.

In practical terms, a high beta means that a small change in the base current will result in a large change in the collector current, making the transistor more efficient as an amplifier. Conversely, a low beta means that a larger change in the base current is needed to achieve the same change in the collector current.

The beta value is not constant and can vary with temperature, collector current, and manufacturing tolerances. Therefore, it is essential to consider these factors when designing circuits that rely on the beta of a transistor.
