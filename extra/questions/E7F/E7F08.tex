        \item Converting data to binary-coded decimal form
        \item \textbf{Reducing the effective sample rate by removing samples}
        \item Attenuating the signal
        \item Removing unnecessary significant digits

\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you have a long list of numbers, and you want to make it shorter without losing the important information. Decimation is like skipping every other number in the list to make it shorter. This process reduces the number of samples, making it easier to handle without losing the essence of the data. Itâ€™s like summarizing a long story into a shorter version that still tells the same tale.

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
Decimation is a signal processing technique used to reduce the effective sample rate of a signal by removing samples. This is typically done by keeping every \(N\)-th sample and discarding the rest, where \(N\) is the decimation factor. Mathematically, if the original signal is \(x[n]\), the decimated signal \(y[m]\) can be expressed as:

\[
y[m] = x[N \cdot m]
\]

where \(m\) is the index of the decimated signal. Decimation is often used in digital signal processing to reduce the computational load or to match the sample rate of a signal to the requirements of a system. It is crucial to apply an anti-aliasing filter before decimation to prevent aliasing, which can distort the signal.

Decimation is widely used in applications such as audio processing, telecommunications, and data compression, where reducing the sample rate can significantly improve efficiency without compromising the quality of the signal.
