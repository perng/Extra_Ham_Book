\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you have a radio signal, and you want to send only one side of it (either the upper or lower part) to save space and make communication more efficient. To do this, you need a special tool that can separate the signal into its two sides. This tool is called a filter. The specific filter that does this job is called a Hilbert-transform filter. Itâ€™s like a magic wand that helps us pick out just the part of the signal we want to use.

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
In digital signal processing, generating a Single Sideband (SSB) signal requires the use of a Hilbert-transform filter. The Hilbert transform is a mathematical operation that shifts the phase of all frequency components of a signal by 90 degrees. This phase shift is crucial for creating the SSB signal because it allows the cancellation of one sideband while preserving the other.

The process involves the following steps:
1. The original signal \( x(t) \) is passed through a Hilbert-transform filter to produce the Hilbert-transformed signal \( \hat{x}(t) \).
2. The Hilbert-transformed signal is then combined with the original signal in a specific way to cancel out one of the sidebands.

Mathematically, the SSB signal \( s(t) \) can be expressed as:
\[
s(t) = x(t) \cos(\omega_c t) \mp \hat{x}(t) \sin(\omega_c t)
\]
where \( \omega_c \) is the carrier frequency, and the sign depends on whether the upper or lower sideband is desired.

The Hilbert-transform filter is essential in this process because it provides the necessary phase shift to achieve the sideband cancellation. Other types of filters, such as adaptive filters, notch filters, or elliptical filters, do not perform this specific function and are therefore not suitable for generating SSB signals.
