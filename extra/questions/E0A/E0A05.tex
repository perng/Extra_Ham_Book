\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you have a flashlight that can shine really far. If you point it at someone, they might feel a lot of light hitting them. Now, think of microwave frequencies like a super powerful flashlight. The antennas used for microwaves are like these flashlights, but instead of light, they send out microwaves. If these antennas are pointed at people, they can get a lot of microwave energy, which can be harmful. So, the big danger is that these strong antennas can expose people to too much microwave energy.

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
Microwave frequencies typically range from 1 GHz to 300 GHz. One of the primary hazards associated with operating at these frequencies is the potential for high exposure levels due to the use of high gain antennas. High gain antennas focus the microwave energy into a narrow beam, which can result in significant power density at a distance. This concentrated energy can pose health risks, such as thermal effects on biological tissues, if safety guidelines are not followed.

The power density \( P \) at a distance \( d \) from an antenna can be calculated using the formula:
\[
P = \frac{P_{\text{transmitted}}}{4 \pi d^2}
\]
where \( P_{\text{transmitted}} \) is the power transmitted by the antenna. For high gain antennas, the effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP) is much higher, leading to increased power density at a given distance.

It is important to note that microwaves are non-ionizing radiation, meaning they do not have enough energy to remove tightly bound electrons from atoms or molecules. However, the thermal effects of prolonged exposure to high levels of microwave energy can still be hazardous.
