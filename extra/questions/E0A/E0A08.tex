\textbf{What does SAR measure?}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*,noitemsep]
    \item Signal attenuation ratio
    \item Signal amplification rating
    \item \textbf{The rate at which RF energy is absorbed by the body}
    \item The rate of RF energy reflected from stationary terrain
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you are holding a smartphone close to your ear while talking. The phone sends out radio waves to communicate with the nearest cell tower. SAR, or Specific Absorption Rate, is like a measure of how much of those radio waves your body absorbs. Think of it as a way to check how much energy from the phone is going into your body. It’s important because too much energy absorption could be harmful, so SAR helps us understand and control this.

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
SAR, or Specific Absorption Rate, quantifies the rate at which radio frequency (RF) energy is absorbed by the human body when exposed to an electromagnetic field. It is typically measured in watts per kilogram (W/kg). The SAR value is crucial in assessing the safety of devices that emit RF energy, such as mobile phones, by ensuring that the energy absorption does not exceed safe limits.

The calculation of SAR involves measuring the electric field strength within a specific volume of tissue and then using the following formula:

\[
\text{SAR} = \frac{\sigma |E|^2}{\rho}
\]

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(\sigma\) is the electrical conductivity of the tissue (in siemens per meter, S/m),
    \item \(|E|\) is the magnitude of the electric field (in volts per meter, V/m),
    \item \(\rho\) is the mass density of the tissue (in kilograms per cubic meter, kg/m³).
\end{itemize}

This formula helps determine how much RF energy is absorbed by the body, ensuring that devices comply with safety standards to protect users from excessive RF exposure.
