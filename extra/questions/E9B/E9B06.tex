\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you’re holding a flashlight and pointing it at the ground. The brightest spot on the ground is where the flashlight is pointing directly. Now, think of the antenna as the flashlight, and the brightest spot is where it’s sending the most signal. The angle at which this brightest spot happens is called the elevation angle. In this case, the antenna’s flashlight is pointing at a very low angle, just 7.5 degrees above the horizon. So, the peak response is at 7.5 degrees. It’s like shining a light just barely above the ground to see something far away!

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
The elevation angle in an antenna radiation pattern refers to the angle above the horizontal plane where the antenna’s radiation is strongest. This angle is crucial in determining the directionality of the antenna’s signal. In this question, the peak response occurs at an elevation angle of \textbf{7.5 degrees}. 

To understand this, consider the antenna’s radiation pattern, which is a graphical representation of the antenna’s radiation properties as a function of space. The peak response is the point where the radiation intensity is maximum. In Figure E9-2, this maximum intensity occurs at 7.5 degrees above the horizon.

Mathematically, the elevation angle \(\theta\) is measured from the horizontal plane (0 degrees) to the direction of maximum radiation. In this case:
\[
\theta = 7.5^\circ
\]
This low elevation angle suggests that the antenna is designed for long-distance communication, as lower angles are more effective for signals traveling over the horizon.

Related concepts include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Radiation Pattern}: A graphical representation of the distribution of radiated energy from an antenna.
    \item \textbf{Elevation Angle}: The angle between the horizontal plane and the direction of maximum radiation.
    \item \textbf{Directivity}: A measure of how focused the antenna’s radiation is in a particular direction.
\end{itemize}
