    \textbf{E9B09} What type of analysis is commonly used for modeling antennas?
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*,noitemsep]
        \item Graphical analysis
        \item \textbf{Method of Moments}
        \item Mutual impedance analysis
        \item Calculus differentiation with respect to physical properties
    \end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you're trying to figure out how a radio antenna works. You could draw pictures (graphical analysis), but that might not give you all the details. Or you could try to measure how antennas affect each other (mutual impedance analysis), but that's like trying to figure out how two people talk without knowing what they're saying. Another option is to use fancy math (calculus differentiation), but that's like trying to solve a puzzle with a million pieces. The best way is to use the Method of Moments. Think of it as breaking the antenna into tiny pieces and figuring out how each piece works. It's like solving a big problem by tackling it one small piece at a time. Easy, right?

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
The Method of Moments (MoM) is a numerical technique widely used in electromagnetics for modeling antennas. It transforms integral equations into a system of linear equations, which can be solved using matrix methods. The process involves discretizing the antenna structure into small segments, often referred to as basis functions. Each segment is then analyzed to determine its contribution to the overall electromagnetic field.

Mathematically, the electric field integral equation (EFIE) is often used in MoM:
\[
\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r}) = \int_V \mathbf{G}(\mathbf{r}, \mathbf{r}') \cdot \mathbf{J}(\mathbf{r}') \, dV'
\]
where \(\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r})\) is the electric field at point \(\mathbf{r}\), \(\mathbf{G}(\mathbf{r}, \mathbf{r}')\) is the Green's function, and \(\mathbf{J}(\mathbf{r}')\) is the current density at point \(\mathbf{r}'\).

The MoM discretizes this integral equation into a matrix equation:
\[
\mathbf{Z} \cdot \mathbf{I} = \mathbf{V}
\]
where \(\mathbf{Z}\) is the impedance matrix, \(\mathbf{I}\) is the current vector, and \(\mathbf{V}\) is the voltage vector. Solving this matrix equation yields the current distribution on the antenna, which can then be used to compute the radiation pattern and other characteristics.

Related concepts include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Basis Functions}: Functions used to approximate the current distribution on the antenna.
    \item \textbf{Green's Function}: A function that describes the response of a system to a point source.
    \item \textbf{Matrix Methods}: Techniques for solving systems of linear equations, crucial for implementing MoM.
\end{itemize}
