    \textbf{E9B08} What is the far field of an antenna?
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*,noitemsep]
        \item The region of the ionosphere where radiated power is not refracted
        \item The region where radiated power dissipates over a specified time period
        \item The region where radiated field strengths are constant
        \item \textbf{The region where the shape of the radiation pattern no longer varies with distance}
    \end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you’re at a concert, and the band is playing on stage. If you’re standing really close to the speakers, the sound might be super loud and a bit distorted. But if you move further back, the sound becomes clearer and more balanced. The far field of an antenna is like that sweet spot where the sound (or in this case, the radio waves) from the antenna is stable and doesn’t change shape as you move further away. It’s the zone where the antenna’s radiation pattern is consistent and predictable.

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
The far field, also known as the Fraunhofer region, is the region far enough from the antenna where the electromagnetic field radiated by the antenna can be approximated as a plane wave. In this region, the angular distribution of the radiated power does not change with distance. The far field begins at a distance \( R \) from the antenna, which is typically defined as:

\[
R > \frac{2D^2}{\lambda}
\]

where \( D \) is the largest dimension of the antenna and \( \lambda \) is the wavelength of the radiated signal. In the far field, the electric and magnetic fields are perpendicular to each other and to the direction of propagation, and the wavefronts are essentially planar. This region is crucial for antenna measurements and applications because the radiation pattern is stable and can be accurately characterized.
