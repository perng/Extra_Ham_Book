\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black]
\textbf{E9D01} How much does the gain of an ideal parabolic reflector antenna increase when the operating frequency is doubled?

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*)]
    \item 2 dB
    \item 3 dB
    \item 4 dB
    \item \textbf{6 dB}
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine your antenna is like a giant ear that listens to radio waves. When you double the frequency, it's like turning up the volume on your favorite songâ€”your antenna becomes twice as good at picking up those waves! But here's the fun part: the gain doesn't just double; it actually increases by 6 dB. That's like going from a whisper to a shout! So, doubling the frequency gives your antenna a cheerful boost, making it much more powerful.

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
The gain of an ideal parabolic reflector antenna is directly related to the operating frequency. The gain \( G \) of such an antenna can be expressed as:

\[
G = \left( \frac{4 \pi A}{\lambda^2} \right) \eta
\]

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( A \) is the area of the parabolic reflector,
    \item \( \lambda \) is the wavelength of the operating frequency,
    \item \( \eta \) is the efficiency of the antenna.
\end{itemize}

When the operating frequency is doubled, the wavelength \( \lambda \) is halved. Substituting \( \lambda' = \frac{\lambda}{2} \) into the gain equation:

\[
G' = \left( \frac{4 \pi A}{\left( \frac{\lambda}{2} \right)^2} \right) \eta = \left( \frac{4 \pi A}{\frac{\lambda^2}{4}} \right) \eta = 4 \left( \frac{4 \pi A}{\lambda^2} \right) \eta = 4G
\]

The gain increases by a factor of 4, which corresponds to a 6 dB increase in logarithmic scale:

\[
10 \log_{10}(4) \approx 6 \text{ dB}
\]

Thus, doubling the frequency results in a 6 dB increase in the gain of an ideal parabolic reflector antenna.
