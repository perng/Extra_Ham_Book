    \textbf{E9D09} What is the function of a loading coil in an electrically short antenna?
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*,noitemsep]
        \item To increase the SWR bandwidth by increasing net reactance
        \item To lower the losses
        \item To lower the Q
        \item \textbf{To resonate the antenna by cancelling the capacitive reactance}

\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you have a tiny antenna that’s too short to catch all the radio waves it needs to. It’s like trying to catch a big fish with a tiny net—it just doesn’t work well! Now, think of a loading coil as a magical tool that helps your tiny antenna act like a bigger one. This coil adds some extra oomph to the antenna, making it resonate just right with the radio waves. It’s like giving your tiny net a stretch so it can catch that big fish after all!

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
An electrically short antenna, which is shorter than a quarter-wavelength, typically exhibits capacitive reactance. This means the antenna behaves like a capacitor, storing energy in the electric field rather than radiating it efficiently. To make the antenna resonate at the desired frequency, we need to cancel out this capacitive reactance with an equal and opposite inductive reactance. This is where the loading coil comes into play.

The loading coil introduces inductive reactance ($X_L$), which is given by:
\[
X_L = 2\pi f L
\]
where $f$ is the frequency and $L$ is the inductance of the coil. When the inductive reactance equals the capacitive reactance ($X_C$), the net reactance becomes zero, and the antenna resonates. This resonance condition is crucial for efficient radiation of electromagnetic waves.

In summary, the loading coil's primary function is to resonate the antenna by cancelling the capacitive reactance, thereby improving its performance.
