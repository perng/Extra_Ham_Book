    \textbf{E9D04} Why should antenna loading coils have a high ratio of reactance to resistance?
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*),noitemsep]
        \item To swamp out harmonics
        \item To lower the radiation angle
        \item \textbf{To maximize efficiency}
        \item To minimize the Q
    \end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you're trying to push a heavy box across a floor. If the floor is super slippery (low resistance), you can push the box really easily and efficiently. But if the floor is sticky (high resistance), you have to work much harder, and some of your energy gets wasted. 

Now, think of the antenna loading coil as the floor, and the signal as the box. A high ratio of reactance to resistance means the floor is slippery, so the signal can move through the coil efficiently without losing much energy. That's why we want a high reactance-to-resistance ratioâ€”it helps the signal stay strong and clear!

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
The efficiency of an antenna loading coil is determined by the ratio of its reactance (\(X_L\)) to its resistance (\(R\)), often referred to as the quality factor (\(Q\)). The quality factor is given by:

\[
Q = \frac{X_L}{R}
\]

A higher \(Q\) indicates that the coil has a higher reactance relative to its resistance, which minimizes energy losses in the form of heat. This is crucial for maximizing the efficiency of the antenna system. 

Reactance (\(X_L\)) is the opposition to the change in current due to the inductance of the coil, and it is calculated as:

\[
X_L = 2\pi f L
\]

where \(f\) is the frequency and \(L\) is the inductance. Resistance (\(R\)) is the inherent opposition to the flow of current, which results in energy dissipation as heat.

By maximizing the ratio \( \frac{X_L}{R} \), we ensure that most of the energy is used to radiate the signal rather than being lost as heat. This is why option C, To maximize efficiency, is the correct answer.
