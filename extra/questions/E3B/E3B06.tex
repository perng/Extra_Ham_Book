    \begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*)]
        \item 160 meters and 80 meters
        \item \textbf{40 meters and 20 meters}
        \item 10 meters and 6 meters
        \item 6 meters and 2 meters

\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you are playing a game of catch with a friend, but instead of throwing the ball directly to them, you throw it all the way around the world! Long-path propagation is like that. It happens when radio waves travel a very long distance, often going around the Earth, to reach their destination. This is most common on certain radio bands, like the 40 meters and 20 meters bands, because these bands have just the right characteristics to make this long journey possible.

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
Long-path propagation occurs when radio waves travel the longer route around the Earth, often in the opposite direction of the shortest path. This phenomenon is influenced by the ionosphere, which reflects radio waves back to the Earth. The 40 meters (7 MHz) and 20 meters (14 MHz) bands are particularly suited for long-path propagation due to their optimal frequency range and ionospheric reflection properties.

The ionosphere consists of several layers (D, E, F1, and F2) that affect radio wave propagation differently. The F2 layer, which is most effective during the day, is crucial for long-path propagation on the 40 meters and 20 meters bands. The critical frequency of the F2 layer typically ranges from 5 MHz to 15 MHz, making these bands ideal for long-distance communication.

To understand why long-path propagation is more frequent on these bands, consider the following:

1. \textbf(Frequency and Ionospheric Reflection): Lower frequencies (like 160 meters and 80 meters) tend to be absorbed by the D layer during the day, while higher frequencies (like 10 meters and 6 meters) may pass through the ionosphere without sufficient reflection. The 40 meters and 20 meters bands strike a balance, allowing for effective reflection and long-distance propagation.

2. \textbf(Solar Activity): The ionosphere's behavior is influenced by solar activity. During periods of high solar activity, the ionosphere becomes more reflective, enhancing long-path propagation on the 40 meters and 20 meters bands.

3. \textbf(Path Length and Attenuation): Longer paths experience more attenuation, but the 40 meters and 20 meters bands have lower attenuation rates compared to higher frequencies, making them more suitable for long-path communication.

In summary, the 40 meters and 20 meters bands are most frequent for long-path propagation due to their optimal frequency range, effective ionospheric reflection, and lower attenuation rates.
