\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=E3B11] At what time of day is sporadic-E propagation most likely to occur?

        \item Between midnight and sunrise
        \item Between sunset and midnight
        \item Between sunset and sunrise

\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine the sky as a giant mirror that helps radio waves bounce around. Sporadic-E propagation is like a special time when this mirror works really well. This usually happens during the day, when the sun is up. The sun heats up parts of the sky, making it easier for radio waves to bounce and travel farther. So, if you want to catch this magic time, look for it between sunrise and sunset!

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
Sporadic-E propagation is a phenomenon where radio waves are reflected by ionized patches in the E-layer of the ionosphere. These patches are typically formed due to solar radiation, which ionizes the atmosphere. The ionization process is most intense during daylight hours when the sun is above the horizon. Therefore, sporadic-E propagation is most likely to occur between sunrise and sunset.

The E-layer of the ionosphere is located at an altitude of approximately 90 to 150 kilometers. During the day, solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation ionizes the gases in this layer, creating free electrons that can reflect radio waves. The intensity of this ionization peaks around midday when the sun is at its highest point in the sky. As a result, the conditions for sporadic-E propagation are optimal during the daytime.

Mathematically, the ionization density \( N_e \) in the E-layer can be approximated by the Chapman function:
\[ N_e = N_0 \exp\left(1 - \frac{h - h_0}{H} - \sec \chi \exp\left(-\frac{h - h_0}{H}\right)\right) \]
where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( N_0 \) is the maximum ionization density,
    \item \( h \) is the altitude,
    \item \( h_0 \) is the reference altitude,
    \item \( H \) is the scale height,
    \item \( \chi \) is the solar zenith angle.
\end{itemize}

The solar zenith angle \( \chi \) is smallest (i.e., the sun is directly overhead) around midday, leading to maximum ionization density and, consequently, optimal conditions for sporadic-E propagation.
