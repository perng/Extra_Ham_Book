\textbf{How is battery operating time calculated?}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*)]
    \item Average current divided by capacity in amp-hours
    \item Average current divided by internal resistance
    \item \textbf{Capacity in amp-hours divided by average current}
    \item Internal resistance divided by average current
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you have a water tank that holds a certain amount of water. The amount of water in the tank is like the battery's capacity, measured in amp-hours. Now, if you have a hose that lets out water at a certain rate, that rate is like the average current. To find out how long the tank will last, you divide the total amount of water by the rate at which it's being used. Similarly, to find out how long a battery will last, you divide its capacity by the average current it's supplying.

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
The operating time of a battery can be calculated using the formula:

\[
\text{Operating Time} = \frac{\text{Capacity (Ah)}}{\text{Average Current (A)}}
\]

Here, \textbf{Capacity} is the total amount of charge the battery can store, measured in amp-hours (Ah). \textbf{Average Current} is the average rate at which the battery is discharging, measured in amperes (A).

For example, if a battery has a capacity of 10 Ah and is discharging at an average current of 2 A, the operating time would be:

\[
\text{Operating Time} = \frac{10 \text{ Ah}}{2 \text{ A}} = 5 \text{ hours}
\]

This formula assumes that the battery is discharging at a constant rate. In real-world scenarios, the discharge rate may vary, but this formula provides a good estimate of the battery's operating time.

\subsubsection{Related Concepts}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Battery Capacity}: The total amount of charge a battery can store, typically measured in amp-hours (Ah).
    \item \textbf{Average Current}: The mean rate at which the battery is discharging, measured in amperes (A).
    \item \textbf{Internal Resistance}: The resistance within the battery itself, which can affect the battery's performance but is not directly used in calculating operating time.
\end{itemize}

% Prompt for generating a diagram: A diagram showing a battery with labels for capacity and average current, along with an arrow indicating the flow of current, would be helpful for visualizing the concept.
