    \begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*)]
        \item By alternating the output between positive and negative voltages
        \item \textbf{By varying the duty cycle of pulses input to a filter}
        \item By varying the conductivity of a pass element
        \item By switching between two Zener diode reference voltages

\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you have a water faucet that you can turn on and off very quickly. If you leave it on for a long time, you get a lot of water. If you turn it off quickly, you get less water. A switchmode voltage regulator works similarly. It quickly turns the power on and off, and by controlling how long it stays on (called the duty cycle), it can control how much power goes to your device. This is like adjusting the faucet to get just the right amount of water.

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
A switchmode voltage regulator operates by rapidly switching a power transistor between its fully on and fully off states. This switching action generates a series of pulses with a specific duty cycle, which is the ratio of the on-time to the total period of the pulse. The duty cycle is controlled by a feedback mechanism that compares the output voltage to a reference voltage. The pulses are then passed through a low-pass filter (typically an inductor and capacitor) to smooth out the waveform, resulting in a stable DC output voltage.

Mathematically, the output voltage \( V_{out} \) can be expressed as:
\[
V_{out} = D \cdot V_{in}
\]
where \( D \) is the duty cycle and \( V_{in} \) is the input voltage. For example, if the input voltage is 12V and the duty cycle is 50\%, the output voltage will be:
\[
V_{out} = 0.5 \cdot 12V = 6V
\]

The efficiency of a switchmode regulator is typically higher than that of a linear regulator because the power transistor is either fully on or fully off, minimizing power dissipation. This makes switchmode regulators ideal for applications where energy efficiency is critical.
