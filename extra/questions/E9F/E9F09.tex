\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black]
    \textbf{E9F09} What impedance does a 1/4-wavelength transmission line present to an RF generator when the line is shorted at the far end?
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*),noitemsep]
        \item \textbf{Very high impedance}
        \item Very low impedance
        \item The same as the characteristic impedance of the transmission line
        \item The same as the generator output impedance
    \end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you're playing with a jump rope. If you hold one end and your friend holds the other end, and you both shake the rope, you can create waves. Now, if your friend suddenly ties their end of the rope to a pole (shorting it), the waves you create will bounce back to you. When the rope is exactly 1/4 of the wavelength of the wave you're making, something interesting happens: the rope seems to resist your shaking a lot! It's like the rope is saying, Nope, I'm not going to move easily! This resistance is what we call very high impedance. So, when a 1/4-wavelength transmission line is shorted at the far end, it presents a very high impedance to the RF generator.

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
A transmission line that is exactly 1/4-wavelength long and shorted at the far end transforms the impedance at the input. The impedance transformation for a transmission line is given by:

\[
Z_{\text{in}} = Z_0 \frac{Z_L + j Z_0 \tan(\beta l)}{Z_0 + j Z_L \tan(\beta l)}
\]

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( Z_{\text{in}} \) is the input impedance,
    \item \( Z_0 \) is the characteristic impedance of the transmission line,
    \item \( Z_L \) is the load impedance (in this case, \( Z_L = 0 \) because the line is shorted),
    \item \( \beta \) is the phase constant (\( \beta = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda} \)),
    \item \( l \) is the length of the transmission line.
\end{itemize}

For a 1/4-wavelength line (\( l = \frac{\lambda}{4} \)), the phase constant \( \beta l = \frac{\pi}{2} \). Substituting \( Z_L = 0 \) and \( \beta l = \frac{\pi}{2} \) into the equation:

\[
Z_{\text{in}} = Z_0 \frac{0 + j Z_0 \tan\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)}{Z_0 + j \cdot 0 \cdot \tan\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)} = Z_0 \frac{j Z_0 \cdot \infty}{Z_0} = \infty
\]

Thus, the input impedance \( Z_{\text{in}} \) is very high, approaching infinity. This is why a 1/4-wavelength transmission line shorted at the far end presents a very high impedance to the RF generator.
