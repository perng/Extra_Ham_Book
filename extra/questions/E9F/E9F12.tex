\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=blue!5!white,colframe=blue!75!black,title=Question E9F12]
\textbf{E9F12} What impedance does a 1/4-wavelength transmission line present to an RF generator when the line is open at the far end?
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*)]
    \item The same as the characteristic impedance of the line
    \item The same as the input impedance to the generator
    \item Very high impedance
    \item \textbf{Very low impedance}
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you’re trying to push a swing. If you push it at just the right moment, it swings really high. But if you push it at the wrong time, it doesn’t go anywhere. A 1/4-wavelength transmission line is like that swing. When it’s open at the far end, it’s like pushing the swing at the wrong time—it doesn’t resist much, so the impedance is very low. It’s like the swing saying, “Hey, I’m not going to fight you, go ahead and push!”

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
A transmission line that is 1/4-wavelength long and open at the far end presents a very low impedance to the RF generator. This can be understood through the concept of impedance transformation. The impedance \( Z_{in} \) at the input of a transmission line of length \( l \) and characteristic impedance \( Z_0 \) terminated with a load impedance \( Z_L \) is given by:

\[
Z_{in} = Z_0 \frac{Z_L + j Z_0 \tan(\beta l)}{Z_0 + j Z_L \tan(\beta l)}
\]

For a 1/4-wavelength line, \( l = \lambda/4 \), so \( \beta l = \pi/2 \). Since \( \tan(\pi/2) \) approaches infinity, the equation simplifies to:

\[
Z_{in} = \frac{Z_0^2}{Z_L}
\]

When the line is open at the far end, \( Z_L \) is very high (approaching infinity), making \( Z_{in} \) very low. This is why the impedance presented to the RF generator is very low.

\subsubsection{Related Concepts}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Characteristic Impedance (\( Z_0 \))}: The inherent impedance of the transmission line, determined by its physical properties.
    \item \textbf{Impedance Transformation}: The process by which the impedance at one end of a transmission line is transformed to a different value at the other end.
    \item \textbf{Wavelength (\( \lambda \))}: The distance over which the wave's shape repeats, related to the frequency and speed of the wave.
\end{itemize}
