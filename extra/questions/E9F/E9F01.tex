\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=Multiple Choice Question]
\textbf{E9F01} What is the velocity factor of a transmission line?

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*,noitemsep]
    \item The ratio of its characteristic impedance to its termination impedance
    \item The ratio of its termination impedance to its characteristic impedance
    \item The velocity of a wave in the transmission line multiplied by the velocity of light in a vacuum
    \item \textbf{The velocity of a wave in the transmission line divided by the velocity of light in a vacuum}
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you're racing a light beam through a transmission line. The velocity factor tells you how much slower your wave is compared to the speed of light in a vacuum. It's like saying, Hey, my wave is only going 70\% as fast as light! So, the velocity factor is simply the speed of your wave divided by the speed of light. Easy peasy!

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
The velocity factor \( VF \) of a transmission line is defined as the ratio of the velocity of a wave \( v \) in the transmission line to the velocity of light \( c \) in a vacuum. Mathematically, this is expressed as:

\[
VF = \frac{v}{c}
\]

Where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( v \) is the velocity of the wave in the transmission line.
    \item \( c \) is the speed of light in a vacuum, approximately \( 3 \times 10^8 \) meters per second.
\end{itemize}

The velocity factor is crucial in determining the electrical length of the transmission line, which affects the phase and timing of signals. It is influenced by the dielectric material surrounding the conductors in the transmission line. Different materials have different permittivities, which in turn affect the velocity of the wave.

For example, if the velocity of a wave in a transmission line is \( 2 \times 10^8 \) meters per second, the velocity factor would be:

\[
VF = \frac{2 \times 10^8}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 0.67
\]

This means the wave travels at 67\% the speed of light in the transmission line.
