\textbf{E9F11} What impedance does a 1/8-wavelength transmission line present to an RF generator when the line is open at the far end?
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*,noitemsep]
    \item The same as the characteristic impedance of the line
    \item An inductive reactance
    \item \textbf{A capacitive reactance}
    \item Infinite

\subsubsection*{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you have a long rope tied to a wall. If you shake the rope, the wave travels down the rope and bounces back when it hits the wall. Now, think of the transmission line as that rope. When the line is open at the far end, it's like the rope is not tied to anything, so the wave bounces back differently. Instead of acting like a spring (inductive), it acts more like a sponge (capacitive). So, the impedance it presents to the RF generator is a capacitive reactance. It's like the line is saying, Hey, I can store energy, but I can't really push it back right now!

\subsubsection*{Advanced Explanation}
For a transmission line of length \( l \) and characteristic impedance \( Z_0 \), the input impedance \( Z_{in} \) when the line is open at the far end is given by:

\[
Z_{in} = -j Z_0 \cot(\beta l)
\]

where \( \beta = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda} \) is the phase constant, and \( \lambda \) is the wavelength. For a 1/8-wavelength line, \( l = \frac{\lambda}{8} \), so:

\[
\beta l = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda} \cdot \frac{\lambda}{8} = \frac{\pi}{4}
\]

Thus,

\[
Z_{in} = -j Z_0 \cot\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) = -j Z_0 \cdot 1 = -j Z_0
\]

The negative imaginary part indicates a capacitive reactance. Therefore, the impedance presented by the 1/8-wavelength open transmission line is a capacitive reactance.
