\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you're playing with a jump rope. When you shake it up and down, you create waves. The speed at which you shake the rope determines how long each wave is. Now, think of the transmission line as a super long jump rope. At 14.10 MHz, the rope is shaking really fast! A half wavelength is like measuring the distance from the top of one wave to the bottom of the next. For this specific shaking speed, that distance is about 10.6 meters. So, the transmission line needs to be about 10.6 meters long to match this half wavelength.

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
To determine the physical length of a transmission line that is electrically 1/2 wavelength long at 14.10 MHz, we need to calculate the wavelength of the signal in air. The speed of light \( c \) is approximately \( 3 \times 10^8 \) meters per second. The frequency \( f \) is 14.10 MHz, which is \( 14.10 \times 10^6 \) Hz.

The wavelength \( \lambda \) can be calculated using the formula:
\[
\lambda = \frac{c}{f}
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
\lambda = \frac{3 \times 10^8}{14.10 \times 10^6} \approx 21.28 \text{ meters}
\]
Since the transmission line is 1/2 wavelength long, we divide the wavelength by 2:
\[
\text{Length} = \frac{\lambda}{2} = \frac{21.28}{2} \approx 10.6 \text{ meters}
\]
Therefore, the correct answer is \textbf{10.6 meters}.

Related concepts include the relationship between frequency, wavelength, and the speed of light, as well as the behavior of electromagnetic waves in transmission lines. Understanding these principles is crucial for designing and analyzing radio frequency systems.
