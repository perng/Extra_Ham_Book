    \textbf{E7A11} What does “positive logic” mean in reference to logic devices?
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*,noitemsep]
        \item The logic devices have high noise immunity
        \item \textbf{High voltage represents a 1, low voltage a 0}
        \item The logic circuit is in the “true” condition
        \item 1s and 0s are defined as different positive voltage levels
    \end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you have a light switch. When you turn it on, the light bulb gets power and lights up. In positive logic, turning the switch on is like sending a 1 signal, which means yes or true. Turning the switch off is like sending a 0 signal, which means no or false. So, positive logic is just a way of saying that a high voltage (like the power going to the light bulb) means 1 and a low voltage (like no power) means 0.

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
In digital electronics, positive logic is a convention where a higher voltage level represents a logical 1 and a lower voltage level represents a logical 0. This is the most commonly used logic convention in digital systems. For example, in TTL (Transistor-Transistor Logic) circuits, a voltage level of approximately 5V represents a logical 1, while a voltage level of approximately 0V represents a logical 0.

The concept of positive logic is fundamental in the design and analysis of digital circuits. It allows engineers to create complex logic functions using simple binary states. The choice of positive logic is arbitrary but widely adopted because it aligns with the natural understanding of high and low states.

In mathematical terms, if we denote the voltage level as \( V \), then:
\[
\text{Logical 1} \iff V \geq V_{high}
\]
\[
\text{Logical 0} \iff V \leq V_{low}
\]
where \( V_{high} \) and \( V_{low} \) are the threshold voltages defining the high and low states, respectively.

Understanding positive logic is crucial for interpreting the behavior of logic gates, such as AND, OR, and NOT gates, which form the building blocks of digital circuits. These gates operate based on the input and output voltage levels, following the positive logic convention.
