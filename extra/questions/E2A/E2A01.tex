\subsection{Cheerful Skies: Navigating an Amateur Satellite's Ascent!}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=E2A01] What is the direction of an ascending pass for an amateur satellite?
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*,noitemsep]
        \item From west to east
        \item From east to west
        \item \textbf{From south to north}

\subsubsection*{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you are watching a satellite move across the sky. An ascending pass means the satellite is moving upward in the sky as it travels. If you think about the Earth's surface, moving upward in the sky from the ground would mean the satellite is moving from the southern part of the sky toward the northern part. So, the satellite is moving from south to north during an ascending pass. Itâ€™s like climbing a hill from the bottom (south) to the top (north)!

\subsubsection*{Advanced Explanation}
In orbital mechanics, the term ascending pass refers to the portion of a satellite's orbit where it is moving from the southern hemisphere to the northern hemisphere. This is determined by the satellite's orbital inclination and the Earth's rotation. 

For an amateur satellite, the ascending pass is characterized by the satellite crossing the equator from south to north. This is because the satellite's orbit is typically inclined relative to the Earth's equatorial plane. The direction of the ascending pass is defined by the satellite's motion relative to the Earth's surface.

Mathematically, the ascending node is the point where the satellite crosses the equatorial plane moving from south to north. The direction of the ascending pass is thus from south to north. This concept is crucial for understanding satellite tracking and predicting the satellite's path across the sky.
