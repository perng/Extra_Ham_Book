    \begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*,noitemsep]
        \item An area surrounding the FCC monitoring station in Laurel, Maryland  
        \item An area in New Mexico surrounding the White Sands Test Area  
        \item \textbf{An area surrounding the National Radio Astronomy Observatory}  
        \item An area in Florida surrounding Cape Canaveral

\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you are trying to listen to a very quiet whisper in a noisy room. It would be really hard to hear, right? The National Radio Quiet Zone is like a special quiet room for scientists who study signals from space. This area is kept very quiet from radio signals so that scientists can listen to the faint sounds coming from stars and galaxies without any interference. Itâ€™s like turning off the TV and radio so you can hear a pin drop!

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
The National Radio Quiet Zone (NRQZ) is a designated area in the United States where radio transmissions are strictly regulated to minimize interference with sensitive radio astronomy observations. The NRQZ spans approximately 13,000 square miles and includes parts of West Virginia, Virginia, and a small portion of Maryland. The primary purpose of the NRQZ is to protect the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) located in Green Bank, West Virginia, which houses the Green Bank Telescope (GBT). The GBT is one of the largest fully steerable radio telescopes in the world and is used to observe faint radio signals from celestial objects.

Radio astronomy relies on detecting extremely weak electromagnetic signals from distant astronomical sources. Any man-made radio interference, such as from cell phones, Wi-Fi, or broadcast stations, can overwhelm these signals, making it impossible to conduct accurate observations. Therefore, the NRQZ enforces strict regulations on the use of radio-emitting devices within its boundaries. This includes limiting the power and frequency of transmissions, as well as prohibiting certain types of equipment altogether.

The NRQZ is a critical component of radio astronomy research, enabling scientists to study phenomena such as pulsars, quasars, and the cosmic microwave background radiation with unparalleled precision. Without the NRQZ, the background noise from human activities would significantly degrade the quality of the data collected by the GBT and other radio telescopes in the area.
