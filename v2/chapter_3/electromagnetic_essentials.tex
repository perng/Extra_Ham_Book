\label{section:electromagnetic_essentials}

\subsection*{Introduction}
This section covers the fundamental concepts of electromagnetic waves, including the relationship between electric and magnetic fields, wave polarization, the velocity of radio waves, and the relationship between wavelength and frequency. These concepts are essential for understanding how radio waves propagate and how they are used in amateur radio.

\subsection*{Electric and Magnetic Fields}
An electromagnetic wave consists of two perpendicular components: an electric field and a magnetic field. These fields oscillate at right angles to each other and to the direction of wave propagation. The relationship between the electric and magnetic fields is such that they are always perpendicular to each other, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:em_fields}.

    % Diagram showing the relationship between electric and magnetic fields in an electromagnetic wave.
    % The electric field (E) is vertical, and the magnetic field (B) is horizontal, both perpendicular to the direction of propagation (k).
\end{figure}

\subsection*{Wave Polarization}
The polarization of a radio wave is defined by the orientation of its electric field. For example, if the electric field oscillates vertically, the wave is said to be vertically polarized. Conversely, if the electric field oscillates horizontally, the wave is horizontally polarized. The magnetic field is always perpendicular to the electric field and does not determine polarization.

\subsection*{Components of a Radio Wave}
A radio wave consists of two primary components: the electric field and the magnetic field. These fields are interdependent and propagate together through space. The electric field is responsible for the wave's interaction with matter, while the magnetic field plays a role in the wave's energy transfer.

\subsection*{Velocity of Radio Waves}
In free space, radio waves travel at the speed of light, which is approximately $3 \times 10^8$ meters per second. This velocity is constant and does not depend on the frequency or wavelength of the wave.

\subsection*{Wavelength and Frequency Relationship}
The wavelength ($\lambda$) and frequency ($f$) of a radio wave are inversely related. This relationship is expressed by the formula:
\begin{equation}
    \lambda = \frac{c}{f}
    \label{eq:wavelength_frequency}
\end{equation}
where $c$ is the speed of light. As frequency increases, wavelength decreases, and vice versa. This relationship is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:wavelength_frequency}.

    \caption{Wavelength vs. frequency relationship.}
    \label{fig:wavelength_frequency}
    % Graph showing the inverse relationship between wavelength and frequency.
    % The x-axis represents frequency (Hz), and the y-axis represents wavelength (m).
\end{figure}

\subsection*{Frequency to Wavelength Conversion}
To convert frequency to wavelength in meters, the following formula is used:
\begin{equation}
    \lambda = \frac{300}{f_{\text{MHz}}}
    \label{eq:frequency_wavelength}
\end{equation}
where $f_{\text{MHz}}$ is the frequency in megahertz. For example, a frequency of 150 MHz corresponds to a wavelength of 2 meters.

\subsection*{Amateur Radio Band Identification}
Amateur radio bands are often identified by their approximate wavelength in meters. For example, the 2-meter band corresponds to frequencies around 144 MHz. Table~\ref{tab:frequency_ranges} summarizes the frequency ranges for VHF, UHF, and HF bands.

\begin{table}[h!]

        \hline
        \textbf{Band} & \textbf{Frequency Range} \\
        \hline
        VHF & 30 MHz to 300 MHz \\
        UHF & 300 MHz to 3000 MHz \\
        HF & 3 MHz to 30 MHz \\
