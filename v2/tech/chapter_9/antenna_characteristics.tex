\subsection*{Half-Wavelength Dipole Antenna}
The length of a half-wavelength dipole antenna can be calculated using the formula:
\begin{equation}
L = \frac{492}{f}
\end{equation}
where \( L \) is the length in feet and \( f \) is the frequency in MHz. For a 6-meter dipole antenna, the frequency is approximately 50 MHz. Plugging this into the formula:
\begin{equation}
L = \frac{492}{50} \approx 9.84 \text{ feet}
\end{equation}
Converting feet to inches (1 foot = 12 inches):
\begin{equation}
L \approx 9.84 \times 12 \approx 118 \text{ inches}
\end{equation}
This is close to the approximate length of 112 inches, as given in the question.

\subsection*{Radiation Pattern of a Half-Wave Dipole Antenna}
A half-wave dipole antenna radiates most strongly in a direction broadside to the antenna. This means the signal is strongest perpendicular to the axis of the antenna. The radiation pattern is typically depicted as a figure-eight shape, with nulls at the ends of the antenna. For a visual representation, refer to Figure~\ref{fig:dipole_radiation}.

\subsection*{Antenna Gain}
Antenna gain is defined as the increase in signal strength in a specified direction compared to a reference antenna, typically an isotropic radiator or a dipole. It is a measure of how effectively the antenna directs energy in a particular direction. Higher gain antennas are useful for long-distance communication as they concentrate the signal in a specific direction, increasing the effective radiated power.

\subsection*{Advantages of a 5/8 Wavelength Whip Antenna}
A 5/8 wavelength whip antenna offers more gain compared to a 1/4-wavelength antenna, making it more efficient for VHF or UHF mobile service. This increased gain results in better signal transmission and reception, especially in mobile applications where space and antenna size are limited.

\end{tcolorbox}
Antenna gain is the increase in signal strength in a specified direction compared to a reference antenna. Options A, B, and D are incorrect because they do not accurately define antenna gain.
