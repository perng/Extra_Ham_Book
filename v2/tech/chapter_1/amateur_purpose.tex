\section{What is Amateur Radio?}

\subsection*{A Brief Dive into Ham Radio History}
\label{sec:ham_history}
The roots of amateur radio can be traced back to the late 19th century, with the rise of wireless telegraphy and the pioneering experiments of individuals like Guglielmo Marconi.  As technology advanced, amateur experimenters played a crucial role in developing and refining radio communication techniques. By the early 20th century, amateur radio operators were establishing cross-country and even international contacts, pushing the boundaries of what was possible with radio waves. Â  

The formation of the American Radio Relay League (ARRL) in 1914 marked a significant milestone in the development of amateur radio. The ARRL fostered a sense of community among amateur operators, advocated for their rights, and promoted the advancement of radio technology.

Amateur radio operators have a long history of contributing to public service, particularly during emergencies when traditional communication systems are disrupted. Their ability to establish reliable communication links in challenging conditions has proven invaluable in countless disaster relief efforts.

Today, amateur radio continues to thrive as a vibrant and diverse community, embracing new digital technologies while maintaining its traditional values of experimentation, skill development, and public service.

\section{Purpose of Amateur Radio Service}
\label{sec:amateur_purpose}

The Amateur Radio Service, as defined by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), serves several fundamental purposes. The primary goal is to advance skills in the technical and communication phases of the radio art. This includes fostering innovation, experimentation, and the development of new technologies within the radio community. Additionally, the service aims to provide a pool of trained operators who can assist in emergency communications when needed.

The FCC plays a crucial regulatory role in overseeing the Amateur Radio Service. It ensures that amateur radio operators adhere to the rules and regulations set forth in Part 97 of the FCC regulations. These rules are designed to maintain order, prevent interference, and promote the efficient use of the radio spectrum.
