\section{Control Operator Requirements}
\label{sec:control_op}

\subsection*{Control Operator Responsibilities}
A control operator is essential for the proper functioning of an amateur radio station. The control operator is responsible for ensuring that all transmissions comply with FCC regulations. This includes verifying that the station operates within the authorized frequency bands and adheres to power limits. The control operator must also ensure that the station identifies itself properly and does not cause harmful interference to other communications.

\subsection*{Types of Station Control}
There are several types of station control, each with its own set of rules and requirements. These include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Manual Control}: The control operator is physically present at the station and directly manipulates the controls.
    \item \textbf{Remote Control}: The control operator is not physically present but operates the station through a remote link, such as the internet.
    \item \textbf{Automatic Control}: The station operates without direct human intervention, such as in the case of a repeater.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Questions}
\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title={T1E01}]
    When may an amateur station transmit without a control operator?
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*),noitemsep]
        \item When using automatic control, such as in the case of a repeater
        \item When the station licensee is away and another licensed amateur is using the station
        \item When the transmitting station is an auxiliary station
        \item \textbf{Never}
    \end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}
An amateur station must always have a control operator. This is a fundamental requirement under FCC regulations to ensure compliance with all operational rules.

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title={T1E02}]
    Who may be the control operator of a station communicating through an amateur satellite or space station?
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*),noitemsep]
        \item Only an Amateur Extra Class operator
        \item A General class or higher licensee with a satellite operator certification
        \item Only an Amateur Extra Class operator who is also an AMSAT member
        \item \textbf{Any amateur allowed to transmit on the satellite uplink frequency}
    \end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}
Any licensed amateur who is authorized to transmit on the satellite uplink frequency can be the control operator. This ensures that the operator has the necessary privileges and knowledge to operate the station correctly.

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title={T1E03}]
    Who must designate the station control operator?
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*),noitemsep]
        \item \textbf{The station licensee}
        \item The FCC
        \item The frequency coordinator
        \item Any licensed operator
    \end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}
The station licensee is responsible for designating the control operator. This ensures that the licensee maintains control over the station's operations and compliance with regulations.

%memory_trick T1E03

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title={T1E04}]
    What determines the transmitting frequency privileges of an amateur station?
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*),noitemsep]
        \item The frequency authorized by the frequency coordinator
        \item The frequencies printed on the license grant
        \item The highest class of operator license held by anyone on the premises
        \item \textbf{The class of operator license held by the control operator}
    \end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}
The class of the control operator's license determines the frequency privileges of the station. This ensures that the station operates within the authorized bands and power limits.

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title={T1E08}]
    Which of the following is an example of automatic control?
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*),noitemsep]
        \item \textbf{Repeater operation}
        \item Controlling a station over the internet
        \item Using a computer or other device to send CW automatically
        \item Using a computer or other device to identify automatically
