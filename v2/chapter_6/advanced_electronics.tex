\subsection*{Rectifiers}
A rectifier is an electronic device that converts alternating current (AC) into direct current (DC). This is achieved by allowing current to flow in only one direction, effectively "rectifying" the AC signal. Rectifiers are commonly used in power supplies to provide a stable DC voltage for electronic devices. The simplest form of a rectifier is the diode, which allows current to pass in one direction while blocking it in the opposite direction. More complex rectifier circuits, such as the full-wave bridge rectifier, are used to improve efficiency and reduce ripple in the output DC signal.

\end{figure}

\subsection*{Relays}
A relay is an electrically-controlled switch that uses a small electrical signal to control a larger current or voltage. Relays are commonly used in applications where it is necessary to control a high-power circuit with a low-power signal, such as in automotive systems or industrial control systems. The basic operation of a relay involves an electromagnet that, when energized, moves a set of contacts to either open or close a circuit.

\end{figure}

\subsection*{Shielded Wire}
Shielded wire is used to prevent the coupling of unwanted signals to or from the wire. This is particularly important in environments where electromagnetic interference (EMI) is a concern, such as in radio frequency (RF) circuits or in data transmission lines. The shield, typically made of a conductive material like copper, surrounds the inner conductor and is grounded to absorb or reflect any interfering signals.

\subsection*{Regulators}
A voltage regulator is a circuit that maintains a constant output voltage regardless of changes in input voltage or load conditions. This is essential in power supplies to ensure that electronic devices receive a stable voltage, which is critical for their proper operation. There are several types of voltage regulators, including linear regulators and switching regulators, each with its own advantages and disadvantages.

        \hline
        Linear Regulator & Simple, low noise & Low-power devices \\
        Switching Regulator & High efficiency, compact & High-power devices \\
