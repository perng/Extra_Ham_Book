\subsection{Powering Fun: Maximum Output for Remote-Controlled Model Crafts!}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=\textbf{E1D06}]
\textbf{What is the maximum permitted transmitter output power when operating a model craft by telecommand?}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
    \item \textbf{1 watt}
    \item 2 watts
    \item 5 watts
    \item 100 watts
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you’re playing with a remote-controlled car or a drone. The remote control sends signals to the toy to make it move. But how strong can those signals be? If the signals are too strong, they might interfere with other devices or even cause problems. That’s why there’s a rule: the remote control can’t send signals stronger than 1 watt. This keeps everything safe and fun for everyone!

\subsubsection*{Advanced Explanation}
When operating a model craft by telecommand, the transmitter output power is regulated to ensure minimal interference with other devices and compliance with safety standards. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in the United States, for instance, limits the maximum transmitter output power to 1 watt for such operations. This limit is set to balance the need for effective communication with the model craft while preventing excessive power that could cause interference or safety hazards.

Mathematically, the power \( P \) in watts is given by:
\[
P = V \times I
\]
where \( V \) is the voltage and \( I \) is the current. However, in this context, the focus is on the regulatory limit rather than the calculation of power. The 1-watt limit ensures that the transmitter operates within a safe and non-interfering range, making it suitable for hobbyist use.

Related concepts include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Transmitter Power}: The amount of power a transmitter uses to send signals.
    \item \textbf{Interference}: When signals from one device disrupt the operation of another.
    \item \textbf{Regulatory Compliance}: Adhering to rules set by authorities like the FCC to ensure safe and fair use of the radio spectrum.
\end{itemize}
