\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine the Earth is like a giant playground, and the Sun is the spotlight shining on it. Sporadic-E propagation is like a special trick that radio waves can do to bounce off a layer in the sky called the E layer. This trick happens most often when the Sun is shining the brightest and longest, which is around the summer solstice. So, if you want to catch this radio wave magic, the best time is during the summer!

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
Sporadic-E (Es) propagation is a phenomenon where radio waves are reflected or refracted by ionized patches in the E layer of the ionosphere, typically at altitudes of 90-120 km. These ionized patches are caused by the ionization of metallic atoms, such as sodium and magnesium, which are believed to originate from meteoroids. The occurrence of sporadic-E is highly dependent on solar activity and the Earth's position relative to the Sun.

The E layer is most ionized during the summer months due to increased solar radiation, especially around the summer solstice when the Sun is at its highest point in the sky. This increased ionization leads to the formation of dense, localized patches in the E layer, which are ideal for sporadic-E propagation. The phenomenon is less common during the winter solstice and equinoxes due to lower solar radiation and different atmospheric conditions.

Mathematically, the critical frequency \( f_c \) for sporadic-E propagation can be estimated using the formula:
\[
f_c = 9 \sqrt{N_e}
\]
where \( N_e \) is the electron density in the E layer. During the summer solstice, \( N_e \) is significantly higher, leading to higher critical frequencies and more frequent sporadic-E events.

Understanding sporadic-E propagation also requires knowledge of the ionosphere's structure, solar-terrestrial interactions, and the impact of geomagnetic activity on ionospheric layers. These factors collectively influence the occurrence and characteristics of sporadic-E propagation.
