\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you are playing a game of catch with a friend, but instead of throwing the ball directly to them, you bounce it off a wall. Now, think of the wall as the ionosphere, a layer of the Earth's atmosphere that can reflect radio waves. Chordal-hop propagation is like throwing the ball so that it bounces off the wall multiple times without ever touching the ground. This means the radio waves keep bouncing between different layers of the ionosphere, traveling long distances without needing to touch the Earth.

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
Chordal-hop propagation is a phenomenon in radio wave propagation where signals undergo successive refractions within the ionosphere without any intermediate reflection from the Earth's surface. The ionosphere consists of several layers (D, E, F1, and F2) that can refract radio waves back to Earth. In chordal-hop propagation, the radio waves are refracted between these layers, effectively hopping along the chord of the Earth's curvature.

Mathematically, the path of the radio wave can be described using Snell's Law of refraction:
\[
n_1 \sin \theta_1 = n_2 \sin \theta_2
\]
where \( n_1 \) and \( n_2 \) are the refractive indices of the ionospheric layers, and \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) are the angles of incidence and refraction, respectively.

This type of propagation is particularly useful for long-distance communication, as it allows signals to travel great distances with minimal loss. It is different from other propagation modes like ground wave or sky wave propagation, where the signal either travels along the Earth's surface or reflects off the ionosphere and back to the ground.
