    \begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*),noitemsep]
        \item 1,000 miles
        \item 2,500 miles
        \item \textbf{5,000 miles}
        \item 7,500 miles
    \end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you are throwing a ball across the equator. The ball represents a radio signal, and the equator is like a giant mirror in the sky. Transequatorial propagation is when radio signals bounce off this mirror and travel very long distances. The maximum distance these signals can travel is about 5,000 miles. This is like throwing the ball so far that it reaches the other side of the equator!

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
Transequatorial propagation (TEP) is a phenomenon where radio signals are refracted by the ionosphere, allowing them to travel long distances across the equator. The ionosphere acts as a reflective layer, especially during periods of high solar activity. The maximum range for signals using TEP is approximately 5,000 miles. This is due to the specific conditions in the ionosphere that allow for such long-distance propagation.

To understand this better, consider the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The ionosphere is divided into layers (D, E, F1, F2), each with different properties.
    \item The F2 layer, in particular, is responsible for long-distance HF propagation.
    \item During the day, the F2 layer is ionized by solar radiation, enhancing its reflective properties.
    \item At night, the F2 layer recombines, reducing its effectiveness.
\end{itemize}

The calculation for the maximum range involves understanding the height of the ionosphere and the angle of incidence of the radio waves. The formula for the maximum range \( R \) is given by:
\[
R = 2 \times h \times \tan(\theta)
\]
where \( h \) is the height of the ionosphere and \( \theta \) is the angle of incidence. For typical conditions, this results in a maximum range of approximately 5,000 miles.
