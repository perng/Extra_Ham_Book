        \item \textbf{The signal experiences less loss compared to multi-hop propagation, which uses Earth as a reflector}
        \item The MUF for chordal-hop propagation is much lower than for normal skip propagation
        \item Atmospheric noise is reduced in the direction of chordal-hop propagation
        \item Signals travel faster along ionospheric chords

\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you are playing a game of catch with a friend. If you throw the ball directly to your friend, it’s easier and faster than bouncing it off the ground first. Chordal-hop propagation is like throwing the ball directly—it’s a more efficient way for radio signals to travel through the ionosphere. Instead of bouncing off the Earth multiple times, the signal takes a more direct path, which means it doesn’t lose as much energy along the way. This makes the signal stronger and clearer when it reaches its destination.

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
Chordal-hop propagation is a mode of radio wave propagation where the signal travels along a chordal path within the ionosphere, rather than reflecting off the Earth’s surface multiple times (multi-hop propagation). This method reduces the signal loss because the signal encounters fewer reflections and absorptions. 

The ionosphere is a layer of the Earth's atmosphere that is ionized by solar radiation. It can reflect radio waves, allowing them to travel long distances. In chordal-hop propagation, the signal is refracted along a chordal path within the ionosphere, which minimizes the number of reflections and thus reduces the attenuation of the signal.

Mathematically, the signal loss \( L \) in multi-hop propagation can be expressed as:
\[ L = n \cdot L_{\text{hop}} \]
where \( n \) is the number of hops and \( L_{\text{hop}} \) is the loss per hop. In chordal-hop propagation, the number of hops \( n \) is significantly reduced, leading to a lower overall loss.

Additionally, the Maximum Usable Frequency (MUF) for chordal-hop propagation is not necessarily lower than for normal skip propagation. The MUF depends on the ionospheric conditions and the angle of incidence of the signal. Chordal-hop propagation can often utilize higher frequencies more effectively due to the reduced path loss.
