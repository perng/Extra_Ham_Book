\textbf{E6A04} What is the name given to an impurity atom that adds holes to a semiconductor crystal structure?
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
    \item Insulator impurity
    \item N-type impurity
    \item \textbf{Acceptor impurity}
    \item Donor impurity
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine a semiconductor as a big playground where electrons are like kids playing. Sometimes, we add special guests (impurity atoms) to the playground. These guests can either bring extra kids (electrons) or take some kids away, leaving empty spots called holes. When the guest takes a kid away, it creates a hole, and we call this kind of guest an acceptor impurity. Itâ€™s like a guest who takes a kid out of the playground, leaving a space where another kid can move into.

\subsubsection*{Advanced Explanation}
In semiconductor physics, the addition of impurities to a pure semiconductor (like silicon) is known as doping. Doping can either increase the number of free electrons or create holes (the absence of electrons) in the crystal lattice. 

An \textbf{acceptor impurity} is an atom that has fewer valence electrons than the semiconductor atoms. When added to the semiconductor, it creates holes in the valence band. For example, in silicon (which has four valence electrons), adding a trivalent impurity like boron (which has three valence electrons) creates a hole because boron cannot provide the fourth electron needed to complete the covalent bond. This hole can then accept an electron from a neighboring atom, effectively moving the hole through the crystal structure.

Mathematically, the process can be described as follows:
\begin{equation}
\text{Boron} + \text{Silicon} \rightarrow \text{Boron}^{-} + \text{Hole}^{+}
\end{equation}
Here, the boron atom becomes negatively charged by accepting an electron, and a positively charged hole is created in the silicon lattice.

Related concepts include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Donor Impurity}: An impurity that donates extra electrons to the semiconductor, creating an N-type semiconductor.
    \item \textbf{Intrinsic Semiconductor}: A pure semiconductor without any impurities.
    \item \textbf{Extrinsic Semiconductor}: A semiconductor that has been doped with impurities to alter its electrical properties.
\end{itemize}
