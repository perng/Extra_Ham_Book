\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine a semiconductor as a material that can conduct electricity, but not as well as a metal. Now, think of electrons as tiny particles that carry electricity. In some semiconductors, there are extra electrons that are free to move around. These extra electrons make it easier for electricity to flow through the material. The type of semiconductor that has these extra free electrons is called N-type. So, if you're looking for a semiconductor with lots of free electrons, you're looking for an N-type semiconductor.

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
Semiconductors are materials with electrical conductivity between conductors (like metals) and insulators (like glass). The conductivity of semiconductors can be controlled by adding impurities, a process known as doping. When a semiconductor is doped with elements that have more valence electrons than the semiconductor material itself, it results in an excess of free electrons. This type of semiconductor is known as N-type.

For example, if silicon (which has four valence electrons) is doped with phosphorus (which has five valence electrons), the extra electron from the phosphorus atom becomes a free electron. This free electron can move through the material, contributing to electrical conductivity. The mathematical representation of this process involves understanding the energy bands in semiconductors, particularly the conduction band where free electrons reside.

The correct answer is \textbf{A: N-type}, as it is the semiconductor material that contains excess free electrons due to the doping process.
