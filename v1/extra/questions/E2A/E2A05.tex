\textbf{E2A05} What do the letters in a satellite’s mode designator specify?
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*),noitemsep]
    \item Power limits for uplink and downlink transmissions
    \item The location of the ground control station
    \item The polarization of uplink and downlink signals
    \item \textbf{The uplink and downlink frequency ranges}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you have a walkie-talkie and you want to talk to your friend who is far away. You both need to agree on which channels to use so you can hear each other clearly. Similarly, satellites use specific frequency ranges to send and receive signals. The letters in a satellite’s mode designator are like a code that tells us which frequency ranges the satellite uses for sending (uplink) and receiving (downlink) signals. This way, everyone knows how to communicate with the satellite without any confusion.

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
Satellite mode designators are standardized codes that specify the frequency ranges used for uplink and downlink communications. These designators are crucial for ensuring that ground stations and satellites can communicate effectively without interference. 

For example, a common mode designator might be L/S, where:
- The first letter L indicates the uplink frequency range, which in this case is in the L-band (1-2 GHz).
- The second letter S indicates the downlink frequency range, which is in the S-band (2-4 GHz).

Understanding these designators requires knowledge of the electromagnetic spectrum and the specific frequency bands allocated for satellite communications. The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) regulates these frequency allocations to prevent interference between different communication systems.

In summary, the letters in a satellite’s mode designator specify the uplink and downlink frequency ranges, ensuring that communication between the satellite and ground stations is clear and efficient.
