\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you are trying to say hello to a friend using a flashlight. If you turn the flashlight on and off very slowly, your friend can clearly see the light and understand your message. However, if you turn it on and off super quickly, it creates quick flashes that can be hard to see and understand. In the same way, if a signal in radio communication turns on or off too quickly, it creates what we call key clicks. These quick changes make it a bit harder for others to understand the transmitted message, just like your friend struggles to see those quick flashes of light.

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
In radio communications, particularly with Continuous Wave (CW) signals, the rise time (the time it takes for the signal to go from off to fully on) and fall time (the time for the signal to go from fully on to off) are crucial parameters. Extremely short rise or fall times can lead to a phenomenon known as key clicking. This occurs because a rapid transition generates high-frequency components in the waveform.

Mathematically, when we analyze the desired CW signal, we often characterize it as a sinusoidal wave:

\[
s(t) = A \cdot \cos(2\pi f t + \phi)
\]

where \( A \) is the amplitude, \( f \) is the frequency, and \( \phi \) is the phase. However, if we introduce very short rise and fall times, the signal cannot be represented as a pure sinusoidal wave but rather contains abrupt transitions. The Fourier Transform of this abrupt waveform reveals that it contains higher frequency harmonics, which correspond to the key clicks observed in practice.

When calculating the impact of these transitions, we can consider their effect in the frequency domain. A square wave, which has very fast rise and fall times, can be expressed as an infinite series of sinusoidal components:

\[
\text{Square wave} = \frac{4}{\pi} \sum_{n=1,3,5,\ldots}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n} \sin\left(2\pi n f t\right)
\]

This series indicates that a rapid transition (short rise and fall times) introduces multiple frequency components, hence creating key clicks that complicate the signal interpretation.

The generation of key clicks can make it challenging for operators to copy the signals accurately and increases bandwidth usage, as these unwanted frequency components spread the signal energy over a wider range of frequencies.
