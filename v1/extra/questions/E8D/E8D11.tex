\textbf{Question ID: E8D11}

What is one advantage of using ASCII code for data communications?
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
    \item It includes built-in error correction features
    \item It contains fewer information bits per character than any other code
    \item \textbf{It is possible to transmit both uppercase and lowercase text}
    \item It uses one character as a shift code to send numeric and special characters
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
ASCII code is like a special language that computers use to talk to each other. Imagine you have a toy box. If all your toys were the same color, it would be hard to tell them apart. But if some were red and some were blue, it would be easier to recognize and organize them. ASCII allows computers to send messages using both big letters (uppercase) and little letters (lowercase), which helps them understand and communicate more clearly. This means that when we send messages, we can use a full range of letters, making our communication richer and more versatile.

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) is a character encoding standard that uses 7 bits to represent characters, allowing for 128 unique symbols, which includes letters, numbers, punctuation marks, and control characters. One fundamental advantage of ASCII is its ability to represent both uppercase (A-Z) and lowercase (a-z) letters, which enhances textual communication.

The main reason for choosing ASCII can be further highlighted by understanding its structure. Each ASCII character corresponds to a unique binary code:

- Uppercase letters range from 65 (A) to 90 (Z)
- Lowercase letters range from 97 (a) to 122 (z)

To transmit these characters, each one must be converted into its corresponding binary form, allowing for comprehensive and diverse text representation in data communications.

Let's analyze further:
\[
\text{For example, the character 'A' is represented in ASCII as:}
\]
\[
A \leftrightarrow 65 \leftrightarrow 01000001 \, (\text{in binary})
\]

Similarly, the character 'a':
\[
a \leftrightarrow 97 \leftrightarrow 01100001 \, (\text{in binary})
\]

Thus, an important aspect of data communication using ASCII is its simplicity and efficiency in coding and transferring letters, which enables both upper and lower case letters' use seamlessly.
