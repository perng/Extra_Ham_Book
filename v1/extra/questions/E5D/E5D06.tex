\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine an inductor as a coil of wire. When you coil the wire, the turns of the wire are very close to each other. Just like how two plates of a capacitor can store electrical energy when they are close together, the turns of the coil can also act like tiny capacitors. This is called inter-turn capacitance. When the inductor is used in a circuit, this tiny capacitance can interact with the inductance of the coil, causing the inductor to resonate at a certain frequency. This is known as self-resonance. So, the parasitic characteristic that creates an inductor’s self-resonance is the inter-turn capacitance.

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
An inductor's self-resonance is primarily caused by the parasitic inter-turn capacitance. In an ideal inductor, the only significant parameter is inductance (\(L\)). However, in a real inductor, the turns of the coil are separated by a dielectric (usually air or insulation), which creates a small capacitance (\(C\)) between adjacent turns. This inter-turn capacitance is distributed along the length of the coil.

The self-resonant frequency (\(f_{\text{SR}}\)) of the inductor can be calculated using the formula for the resonant frequency of an LC circuit:

\[
f_{\text{SR}} = \frac{1}{2\pi\sqrt{LC}}
\]

Where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(L\) is the inductance of the coil.
    \item \(C\) is the inter-turn capacitance.
\end{itemize}

At this frequency, the inductor behaves more like a resonant circuit rather than a pure inductor. The inter-turn capacitance is a parasitic element because it is not intentionally designed into the inductor but arises from the physical construction of the coil. Other parasitic effects like skin effect, dielectric loss, and coupling can also affect the inductor's performance, but they do not directly cause self-resonance.

Understanding the self-resonant frequency is crucial in RF and high-frequency circuits, as operating near or above this frequency can lead to unexpected behavior and degraded performance of the inductor.
