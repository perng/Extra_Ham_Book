\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you have a transistor amplifier that boosts signals for your radio. Sometimes, unwanted high-frequency signals (like VHF and UHF) sneak into the amplifier and cause problems. To stop these unwanted signals, we use something called a parasitic suppressor. Think of it like a filter that blocks the bad signals while letting the good ones pass. Ferrite beads are like tiny magnets that absorb these unwanted high-frequency signals, making sure your amplifier works smoothly.

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
In high-frequency (HF) amplifiers, parasitic oscillations can occur due to the presence of very high-frequency signals (VHF and UHF) at the input and output terminals. These oscillations can degrade the performance of the amplifier. To suppress these parasitic oscillations, ferrite beads are commonly used. Ferrite beads are passive components that act as high-frequency resistors, dissipating the energy of the unwanted signals as heat. They are made of a ferromagnetic material, which has high permeability and can effectively attenuate high-frequency signals without affecting the desired HF signals.

The impedance of a ferrite bead increases with frequency, making it an effective suppressor for VHF and UHF signals. The impedance \( Z \) of a ferrite bead can be approximated by the following equation:

\[
Z = R + jX_L
\]

where \( R \) is the resistive component and \( X_L \) is the inductive reactance. At high frequencies, \( X_L \) dominates, providing significant impedance to block the unwanted signals.

Other options like electrolytic capacitors, Butterworth filters, and steel-core toroids are not typically used for this purpose. Electrolytic capacitors are not effective at high frequencies, Butterworth filters are designed for specific frequency responses, and steel-core toroids do not provide the necessary high-frequency suppression.
