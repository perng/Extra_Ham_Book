\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=E6D01] What is piezoelectricity?
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*),noitemsep]
        \item The ability of materials to generate electromagnetic waves of a certain frequency when voltage is applied
        \item A characteristic of materials that have an index of refraction which depends on the polarization of the electromagnetic wave passing through it
        \item \textbf{A characteristic of materials that generate a voltage when stressed and that flex when a voltage is applied}
        \item The ability of materials to generate voltage when an electromagnetic wave of a certain frequency is applied
    \end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you have a special kind of material, like a crystal or certain ceramics. When you squeeze or press this material, it can create a tiny electric voltage, almost like a small battery. On the flip side, if you apply an electric voltage to this material, it can bend or flex. This magical property is called piezoelectricity. It’s like the material can turn pressure into electricity and electricity into movement!

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
Piezoelectricity is a property exhibited by certain materials, such as quartz, Rochelle salt, and some ceramics, where mechanical stress induces an electric charge (direct piezoelectric effect) and, conversely, an applied electric field induces mechanical strain (inverse piezoelectric effect). This phenomenon arises due to the displacement of ions within the crystal lattice when subjected to mechanical stress, leading to the generation of an electric dipole moment.

Mathematically, the direct piezoelectric effect can be expressed as:
\[ P = d \cdot \sigma \]
where \( P \) is the polarization (electric dipole moment per unit volume), \( d \) is the piezoelectric coefficient, and \( \sigma \) is the applied mechanical stress.

The inverse piezoelectric effect is described by:
\[ \epsilon = d \cdot E \]
where \( \epsilon \) is the strain (deformation) and \( E \) is the applied electric field.

Piezoelectric materials are widely used in various applications, including sensors, actuators, and transducers, due to their ability to convert mechanical energy into electrical energy and vice versa.
