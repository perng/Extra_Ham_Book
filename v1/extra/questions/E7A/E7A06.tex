\textbf{What is a characteristic of a monostable multivibrator?}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
    \item \textbf{It switches temporarily to an alternate state for a set time}
    \item It produces a continuous square wave
    \item It stores one bit of data
    \item It maintains a constant output voltage, regardless of variations in the input voltage
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you have a light switch that, when you press it, turns on the light for exactly 10 seconds and then automatically turns off. A monostable multivibrator works similarly. It has one stable state (like the light being off) and one temporary state (like the light being on). When triggered, it switches to the temporary state for a specific amount of time before returning to its stable state. This makes it useful for timing applications where you need a precise duration of an event.

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
A monostable multivibrator, also known as a one-shot multivibrator, is a type of electronic circuit that has two states: a stable state and a quasi-stable state. The circuit remains in its stable state until an external trigger is applied. Upon receiving the trigger, it switches to the quasi-stable state for a predetermined period, determined by the circuit's time constant (usually set by an RC network), before returning to the stable state.

Mathematically, the duration \( T \) of the quasi-stable state can be calculated using the formula:
\[
T = \tau \ln(2)
\]
where \( \tau \) is the time constant of the RC network, given by:
\[
\tau = R \times C
\]
Here, \( R \) is the resistance and \( C \) is the capacitance in the circuit.

Monostable multivibrators are commonly used in applications such as pulse generation, timing circuits, and debouncing switches. They are essential in digital electronics for creating precise time delays.
