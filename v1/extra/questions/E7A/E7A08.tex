\textbf{What logical operation does an OR gate perform?}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*),noitemsep]
    \item \textbf{It produces a 1 at its output if any input is 1}
    \item It produces a 0 at its output if all inputs are 1
    \item It produces a 0 at its output if some but not all inputs are 1
    \item It produces a 1 at its output if all inputs are 0
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you have a light switch that turns on a bulb. Now, suppose you have two switches connected to the same bulb. If either switch is turned on, the bulb will light up. This is similar to how an OR gate works. The OR gate checks if any of its inputs are on (which we represent as 1). If at least one input is 1, the output will also be 1. If all inputs are 0, the output will be 0. So, the OR gate is like saying, If this OR that is true, then the result is true.

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
An OR gate is a digital logic gate that implements logical disjunction. It has two or more inputs and one output. The output of an OR gate is 1 (true) if at least one of its inputs is 1. Mathematically, the OR operation can be represented using the following truth table:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
\text{Input A} & \text{Input B} & \text{Output} \\
\hline
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & 1 \\
1 & 1 & 1 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

The logical OR operation can be expressed using the Boolean algebra notation as:
\[
\text{Output} = A + B
\]
where \( A \) and \( B \) are the inputs, and the + symbol represents the logical OR operation.

In digital circuits, OR gates are fundamental building blocks used in various applications, such as in arithmetic logic units (ALUs), multiplexers, and other combinatorial logic circuits. Understanding the behavior of OR gates is crucial for designing and analyzing digital systems.
