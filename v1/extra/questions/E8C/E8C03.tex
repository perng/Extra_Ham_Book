    \textbf{Question ID: E8C03} \\
    Why should the phase of a PSK signal be changed at the zero crossing of the RF signal? 
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
        \item \textbf{To minimize bandwidth}
        \item To simplify modulation
        \item To improve carrier suppression
        \item All these choices are correct
    \end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
When we talk about PSK signals, we are discussing how information is sent using different phases of a wave. Now, imagine a wave as a path that an object moves along. At some points, this wave goes straight through the middle, called the zero crossing. When we change the phase at this important point, it helps us do a better job transmitting our information without using too much space. This is like making sure that when you pass a note in class, you do it at just the right moment when nobody is looking, so it doesn't get lost or messed up!

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
In Phase Shift Keying (PSK), the phase of the carrier signal is varied to convey information. The zero crossings of a radio frequency (RF) signal are significant points where the waveform changes its direction of travel, which is theoretically the most stable point for making any phase adjustments. 

The reason for changing the phase at the zero crossing is to minimize the potential for cross-talk or errors in detection due to phase ambiguity. Specifically, when the phase is adjusted at these points, we enhance the signal integrity and create a clearer distinction between adjacent symbols.

Now, consider the bandwidth implications. Bandwidth of a signal refers to the range of frequencies that a signal occupies. If the phase changes are optimized (like through zero crossings), we can minimize unnecessary usage of the spectrum. This is a crucial aspect in communication systems where bandwidth availability is often limited.

Thus, the correct answer is: \textbf{A: To minimize bandwidth}. 

To provide a mathematical perspective, the signal can be expressed as:
\[
s(t) = A \cos(2\pi f_c t + \phi(t))
\]
where \(\phi(t)\) is the phase function. At the point of zero crossing, the optimal strategy involves adjusting \(\phi(t)\) to maintain signal clarity and minimize bandwidth usage.
