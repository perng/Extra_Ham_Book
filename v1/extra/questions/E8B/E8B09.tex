    What is deviation ratio? \\ 
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
        \item The ratio of the audio modulating frequency to the center carrier frequency
        \item \textbf{The ratio of the maximum carrier frequency deviation to the highest audio modulating frequency}
        \item The ratio of the carrier center frequency to the audio modulating frequency
        \item The ratio of the highest audio modulating frequency to the average audio modulating frequency
    \end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
The deviation ratio is a way to understand how much the frequency of a signal can change compared to the sound or music that is changing it. Imagine you are listening to music on the radio, and the radio makes the sound louder or softer. The deviation ratio tells us how much louder or softer the sound can be compared to the original music being played. It helps engineers understand how well the radio can pick up and transmit the sounds we want to hear.

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
The deviation ratio is an important concept in communications, especially in frequency modulation (FM) systems. It can be mathematically defined as the ratio of the maximum frequency deviation (the extent to which the signal frequency varies from its center frequency) to the highest frequency of the audio signal that is modulating the carrier.

Let \( f_{\Delta} \) be the maximum deviation and \( f_m \) be the highest audio modulating frequency. The deviation ratio \( DR \) is given by:

\[
DR = \frac{f_{\Delta}}{f_m}
\]

This ratio indicates how much the carrier signal is allowed to deviate based on the input audio's highest frequency. A larger deviation ratio leads to better signal quality and reception because it allows more of the audio signal's nuances to be captured and transmitted.

In practice, for a communication system to maintain clarity and avoid interference, engineers must consider both \( f_{\Delta} \) and \( f_m \). Understanding these helps in designing efficient transmission systems.
