\subsection{Decoding the Frequency Limits of Your Digital Oscilloscope!}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10, colframe=black, title=E4A01]
Which of the following limits the highest frequency signal that can be accurately displayed on a digital oscilloscope?
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
    \item \textbf{A} Sampling rate of the analog-to-digital converter
    \item B Analog-to-digital converter reference frequency
    \item C Q of the circuit
    \item D All these choices are correct
\end{enumerate} \end{tcolorbox}

\subsubsection{Correct Answer}


\subsubsection{Related Concepts}
To understand why the sampling rate of the analog-to-digital converter (ADC) limits the highest frequency signal displayed on a digital oscilloscope, we need to consider the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem. This theorem states that in order to accurately capture a signal without aliasing, it must be sampled at least twice the highest frequency present in the signal.

\subsubsection{Calculation}
Let \( f_{max} \) be the maximum frequency of the signal and \( f_s \) be the sampling frequency of the ADC. According to the Nyquist theorem, the following must hold true:

\begin{equation}
f_s \geq 2f_{max}
\end{equation}

Rearranging for \( f_{max} \):

\begin{equation}
f_{max} \leq \frac{f_s}{2}
\end{equation}

For example, if an oscilloscope has an ADC with a sampling rate of 1 GHz, the maximum frequency that can be accurately displayed without aliasing would be:

\begin{equation}
f_{max} \leq \frac{1 \text{ GHz}}{2} = 500 \text{ MHz}
\end{equation}

This implies that signals of frequency higher than 500 MHz would not be accurately represented, and potential aliasing could occur.
