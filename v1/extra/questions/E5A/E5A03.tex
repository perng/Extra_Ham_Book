\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=\textbf{E5A03}]
\textbf{What is the magnitude of the impedance of a series RLC circuit at resonance?}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
    \item High, compared to the circuit resistance
    \item Approximately equal to capacitive reactance
    \item Approximately equal to inductive reactance
    \item \textbf{Approximately equal to circuit resistance}
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you have a series RLC circuit, which is like a team of three players: a resistor (R), an inductor (L), and a capacitor (C). At resonance, the inductor and capacitor are perfectly balanced, like two teammates canceling each other out. This leaves the resistor as the main player. The impedance, which is like the total resistance of the circuit, is mostly determined by the resistor. So, at resonance, the impedance is approximately equal to the circuit resistance.

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
In a series RLC circuit, the impedance \( Z \) is given by:
\[
Z = \sqrt{R^2 + (X_L - X_C)^2}
\]
where \( R \) is the resistance, \( X_L \) is the inductive reactance, and \( X_C \) is the capacitive reactance. At resonance, the inductive reactance \( X_L \) and capacitive reactance \( X_C \) are equal:
\[
X_L = X_C
\]
Substituting this into the impedance equation, we get:
\[
Z = \sqrt{R^2 + (X_L - X_L)^2} = \sqrt{R^2 + 0} = R
\]
Thus, at resonance, the magnitude of the impedance \( Z \) is approximately equal to the circuit resistance \( R \).

\subsubsection{Related Concepts}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Resonance Frequency}: The frequency at which the inductive and capacitive reactances are equal, given by \( f_0 = \frac{1}{2\pi\sqrt{LC}} \).
    \item \textbf{Impedance}: The total opposition to current flow in an AC circuit, combining resistance and reactance.
    \item \textbf{Reactance}: The opposition to current flow due to inductance or capacitance, which varies with frequency.
\end{itemize}
