    \textbf{E9B04} What is the front-to-back ratio of the radiation pattern shown in Figure E9-2?
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*),noitemsep]
        \item 15 dB
        \item \textbf{28 dB}
        \item 3 dB
        \item 38 dB
    \end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you're holding a flashlight in a dark room. The front-to-back ratio is like comparing how bright the light is in front of you versus how much light is sneaking around to the back. In this case, the flashlight is really good at shining forward and not so much backward. The front-to-back ratio tells us how much better it is at shining forward. Here, it's 28 dB, which means the front is way brighter than the back!

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
The front-to-back ratio (F/B ratio) is a measure used in antenna theory to describe the directivity of an antenna. It is defined as the ratio of the power radiated in the forward direction to the power radiated in the opposite direction. Mathematically, it is expressed in decibels (dB) as:

\[
\text{F/B Ratio (dB)} = 10 \log_{10}\left(\frac{P_{\text{forward}}}{P_{\text{backward}}}\right)
\]

Where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( P_{\text{forward}} \) is the power radiated in the forward direction.
    \item \( P_{\text{backward}} \) is the power radiated in the backward direction.
\end{itemize}

In the context of the question, the radiation pattern shown in Figure E9-2 indicates that the F/B ratio is 28 dB. This means that the power radiated in the forward direction is significantly higher than that in the backward direction, which is desirable for many communication applications to minimize interference and maximize signal strength in the intended direction.
