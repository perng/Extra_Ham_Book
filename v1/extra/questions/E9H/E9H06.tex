\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=Question E9H06]
\textbf{E9H06} What indicates the correct value of terminating resistance for a Beverage antenna?
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
    \item Maximum feed point DC resistance at the center of the desired frequency range
    \item Minimum low-angle front-to-back ratio at the design frequency
    \item Maximum DC current in the terminating resistor
    \item \textbf{Minimum variation in SWR over the desired frequency range}
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsubsection*{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine your Beverage antenna is like a long, stretchy rubber band. If you pull it too tight, it might snap, but if it's too loose, it won't work well. The terminating resistance is like finding the perfect tension for your rubber band. You want it to be just right so that the antenna can send and receive signals smoothly without any hiccups. The correct value is the one that keeps the antenna happy and working well across all the frequencies you want to use. That's why we look for the minimum variation in SWR (Standing Wave Ratio) over the desired frequency range. It's like making sure your rubber band is perfectly stretched for all the different ways you want to use it!

\subsubsection*{Advanced Explanation}
The terminating resistance in a Beverage antenna is crucial for ensuring efficient signal transmission and reception. The Beverage antenna is a long-wire antenna that relies on a terminating resistor to absorb the signal at the end of the wire, preventing reflections that could cause standing waves. The correct value of terminating resistance is determined by minimizing the variation in the Standing Wave Ratio (SWR) over the desired frequency range. 

The SWR is a measure of how well the antenna is matched to the transmission line. A low SWR indicates a good match, meaning that most of the power is being radiated by the antenna rather than being reflected back into the transmission line. Mathematically, the SWR is given by:

\[
\text{SWR} = \frac{1 + |\Gamma|}{1 - |\Gamma|}
\]

where \(\Gamma\) is the reflection coefficient. The reflection coefficient is related to the impedance mismatch between the antenna and the transmission line. By minimizing the variation in SWR, we ensure that the antenna operates efficiently across the entire frequency range of interest.

In practical terms, this means selecting a terminating resistor that matches the characteristic impedance of the antenna as closely as possible. This minimizes reflections and ensures that the antenna performs optimally. The correct answer, therefore, is the one that results in the minimum variation in SWR over the desired frequency range.
