\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you’re trying to shout across a field. If the ground is wet and muddy, your voice doesn’t travel as far because the mud soaks up the sound. But if the ground is dry and hard, your voice carries much farther. Similarly, for a vertical antenna on the ground, the type of soil it’s sitting on affects how well it can send out radio waves. If the soil is conductive (like wet mud), it absorbs more of the radio energy, causing ground losses. So, the key factor here is the soil conductivity—how well the soil can conduct electricity.

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
Ground losses in a ground-mounted vertical antenna are primarily influenced by the conductivity of the soil (\(\sigma\)) and its permittivity (\(\epsilon\)). When an antenna radiates, part of the electromagnetic energy is absorbed by the ground, especially in the near-field region. The loss is quantified by the ground conductivity, which determines how effectively the soil can dissipate the energy. 

The ground loss (\(P_{\text{loss}}\)) can be approximated using the following relationship:
\[
P_{\text{loss}} \propto \frac{1}{\sigma}
\]
where \(\sigma\) is the soil conductivity. Higher conductivity results in lower ground losses, as the soil can better conduct the induced currents. Conversely, poor conductivity (e.g., dry or sandy soil) leads to higher losses.

The standing wave ratio (SWR) and take-off angle are related to antenna performance but do not directly determine ground losses. Distance from the transmitter affects signal strength but not the ground losses themselves. Therefore, the correct answer is \textbf{C: Soil conductivity}.
