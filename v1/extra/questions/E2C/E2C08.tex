\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you have a special notebook called the Logbook of The World (LoTW) where you can write down all the radio stations you've talked to. Now, you might wonder, Can I write down all kinds of contacts in this notebook? The answer is yes! Whether you talked to a special event station in the US, a station in another country, or even if you're trying to get a special award for talking to stations in all 50 states, you can confirm all these contacts in your LoTW notebook. It's like a universal diary for all your radio adventures!

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
The Logbook of The World (LoTW) is an online system developed by the American Radio Relay League (ARRL) that allows amateur radio operators to confirm contacts (QSOs) electronically. It serves as a digital logbook and is widely used for award tracking and verification. 

The system is designed to confirm a wide range of contacts, including:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Special Event Contacts}: These are contacts made with stations that are operating for a specific event, often within the US.
    \item \textbf{International Contacts}: Contacts between a US station and a non-US station are also eligible for confirmation through LoTW.
    \item \textbf{Worked All States (WAS) Contacts}: Contacts that contribute to the WAS award, which requires confirmation of contacts with stations in all 50 US states, can be confirmed via LoTW.
\end{itemize}

Since LoTW is a comprehensive system, it supports the confirmation of all these types of contacts. Therefore, the correct answer is \textbf{D: All these choices are correct}.
