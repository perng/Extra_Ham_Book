\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you have a radio that can change the pitch of the sound it sends out. A reactance modulator is like a special tool that helps the radio do this by tweaking something called capacitance. Capacitance is like a sponge that can soak up and release electrical energy. By changing how much this sponge can hold, the radio can make the sound pitch go up and down, creating what we call PM (Phase Modulation) or FM (Frequency Modulation) signals. This is different from AM (Amplitude Modulation), which changes how loud the sound is instead of its pitch.

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
A reactance modulator is a circuit used in radio frequency (RF) communication to generate phase modulation (PM) or frequency modulation (FM) signals. The key component in a reactance modulator is a variable reactance, typically a capacitor, whose value can be varied in response to the modulating signal. The reactance modulator works by altering the phase or frequency of the carrier signal in proportion to the modulating signal.

Mathematically, the reactance \( X \) of a capacitor is given by:
\[
X = \frac{1}{2\pi f C}
\]
where \( f \) is the frequency of the signal and \( C \) is the capacitance. By varying \( C \), the reactance \( X \) changes, which in turn alters the phase or frequency of the carrier signal.

For example, if the capacitance \( C \) is increased, the reactance \( X \) decreases, leading to a phase shift in the carrier signal. This phase shift is proportional to the modulating signal, resulting in phase modulation (PM). Similarly, if the capacitance is varied in a way that changes the frequency of the carrier signal, frequency modulation (FM) is achieved.

In summary, a reactance modulator produces PM or FM signals by varying a capacitance, making option D the correct answer.
