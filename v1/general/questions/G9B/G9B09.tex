\subsubsection*{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you're trying to send a message across a field. If you hold your antenna horizontally, it's like lying down on the ground, which means it doesn't have to fight as much with the earth to send your message. This makes it easier for the signal to travel further without losing energy. So, using a horizontally polarized antenna can help reduce the energy lost to the ground, making your communication more efficient.

\subsubsection*{Advanced Explanation}
In radio communications, polarization refers to the orientation of the electric field of the radio wave. Horizontally polarized antennas have their electric field parallel to the Earth's surface, while vertically polarized antennas have their electric field perpendicular to the Earth's surface. 

One of the key advantages of horizontally polarized antennas, especially in HF (High Frequency) bands, is the reduction in ground losses. Ground losses occur when the radio wave interacts with the Earth's surface, causing energy to be absorbed and dissipated as heat. Horizontally polarized antennas tend to have lower ground losses because the electric field is less likely to induce currents in the ground compared to vertically polarized antennas.

Mathematically, the ground loss \( P_{\text{ground}} \) can be expressed as:
\[ P_{\text{ground}} = I^2 R_{\text{ground}} \]
where \( I \) is the current induced in the ground and \( R_{\text{ground}} \) is the ground resistance. For horizontally polarized antennas, \( I \) is generally smaller, leading to lower \( P_{\text{ground}} \).

Additionally, horizontally polarized antennas can be more effective in certain propagation modes, such as skywave propagation, where the signal reflects off the ionosphere. This can result in better long-distance communication performance.
