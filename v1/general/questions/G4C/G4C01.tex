    \item Reverse-biased diode
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine your audio circuit is like a quiet library, and RF interference is like a bunch of noisy kids running around. To keep the library quiet, you need something that can block the noise. A bypass capacitor is like a librarian who shushes the noisy kids, letting only the quiet whispers (audio signals) through. It acts as a filter, blocking the high-frequency RF noise while allowing the low-frequency audio signals to pass undisturbed.

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
RF interference can couple into audio circuits through various means, such as capacitive or inductive coupling. A bypass capacitor is used to shunt high-frequency RF signals to ground, effectively filtering them out. The capacitor's impedance \( Z \) is given by:

\[
Z = \frac{1}{j\omega C}
\]

where \( \omega \) is the angular frequency of the RF signal, and \( C \) is the capacitance. For high frequencies, \( Z \) is very low, allowing the RF signals to be bypassed to ground. This prevents the RF interference from affecting the audio signals, which operate at much lower frequencies.

In contrast, a bypass inductor would block low-frequency signals, which is not desirable in this context. Diodes, whether forward-biased or reverse-biased, do not serve the purpose of filtering RF interference in audio circuits. Therefore, the bypass capacitor is the most effective solution for reducing RF interference in audio frequency circuits.
