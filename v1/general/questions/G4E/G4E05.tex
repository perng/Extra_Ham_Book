    \item “Picket fencing”
    \item The wire gauge of the DC power line to the transceiver
    \item \textbf{Efficiency of the electrically short antenna}

\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you're trying to talk to your friend across a big field using a walkie-talkie. If your walkie-talkie's antenna is too short, it’s like whispering instead of shouting—your message won’t go very far. In an HF mobile installation, the antenna is often short because it’s mounted on a car. This short antenna isn’t very efficient at sending out your radio signals, which is the biggest problem. So, even if you have a fancy radio and thick power cables, if your antenna isn’t doing its job well, your communication will be limited.

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
In HF (High Frequency) mobile installations, the antenna's efficiency is a critical factor. An electrically short antenna, which is much shorter than the wavelength of the transmitted signal, has a lower radiation resistance compared to its loss resistance. This results in poor radiation efficiency, meaning a significant portion of the transmitted power is lost as heat rather than being radiated as electromagnetic waves.

The efficiency \(\eta\) of an antenna can be expressed as:
\[
\eta = \frac{R_r}{R_r + R_l}
\]
where \(R_r\) is the radiation resistance and \(R_l\) is the loss resistance. For an electrically short antenna, \(R_r\) is typically very low, leading to a low efficiency.

Other factors like picket fencing (signal fading due to multipath propagation), the wire gauge of the DC power line, and FCC power limitations can also affect performance, but they are generally less significant compared to the inefficiency of the antenna. Therefore, the efficiency of the electrically short antenna is the most limiting factor in an HF mobile installation.
