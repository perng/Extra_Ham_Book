\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=G1E12]
When may third-party messages be transmitted via remote control?
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*),noitemsep]
    \item \textbf{Under any circumstances in which third party messages are permitted by FCC rules}
    \item Under no circumstances except for emergencies
    \item Only when the message is intended for licensed radio amateurs
    \item Only when the message is intended for third parties in areas where licensing is controlled by the FCC
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you're playing a game where you can send messages to your friends using a walkie-talkie. Now, let's say you want to send a message to a friend of a friend (that's the third party). The rules of the game (in this case, the FCC rules) say that as long as you're allowed to send messages to third parties, you can do it using your walkie-talkie, even if you're controlling it from far away (remote control). So, the answer is simple: if the rules say it's okay, you can do it!

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulates the use of radio frequencies in the United States. According to FCC rules, third-party messages—messages intended for someone other than the licensed operator—can be transmitted via remote control under specific conditions. The key point here is that the transmission must comply with the FCC's regulations regarding third-party communications. 

The correct answer, \textbf{A}, states that third-party messages may be transmitted via remote control under any circumstances in which such messages are permitted by FCC rules. This means that as long as the FCC allows third-party communications in a given context, the use of remote control for transmitting these messages is also permitted. 

It's important to note that the FCC's rules are designed to ensure that radio communications are used responsibly and do not interfere with other users. Therefore, any transmission, including third-party messages, must adhere to these rules to avoid penalties or license revocation.
