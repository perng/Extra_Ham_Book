\label{T5B08}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=T5B08]
Which is equal to 1,000,000 picofarads?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item 0.001 microfarads
    \item \textbf{1 microfarad}
    \item 1000 microfarads
    \item 1,000,000,000 microfarads
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsubsection*{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you have a tiny bucket called a picofarad (pF) that can hold a very small amount of water. Now, if you have 1,000,000 of these tiny buckets, how many bigger buckets called microfarads ($\mu$F) would you need to hold the same amount of water? The answer is 1 microfarad, because 1,000,000 picofarads is equal to 1 microfarad. It's like converting 1,000,000 pennies into dollarsâ€”you get 1 dollar!

\subsubsection*{Advanced Explanation}
Capacitance is measured in farads (F), but in practical applications, we often use smaller units like microfarads ($\mu$F) and picofarads (pF). The relationship between these units is as follows:
\[
1 \text{ microfarad} (\mu F) = 1,000,000 \text{ picofarads} (pF)
\]
Therefore, 1,000,000 picofarads is equivalent to 1 microfarad. This conversion is straightforward and does not require complex calculations, but it is essential to understand the relationship between these units when working with capacitors in electronic circuits.
