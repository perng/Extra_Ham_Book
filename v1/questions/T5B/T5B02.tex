\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=T5B02]
Which is equal to 1,500,000 hertz?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item \textbf{1500 kHz}
    \item 1500 MHz
    \item 15 GHz
    \item 150 kHz
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsubsection*{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you have a big number like 1,500,000 hertz (Hz). To make it easier to talk about, we can convert it into smaller units like kilohertz (kHz) or megahertz (MHz). Think of it like converting dollars into cents or euros. In this case, 1,500,000 Hz is the same as 1500 kHz because 1 kHz equals 1000 Hz.

\subsubsection*{Advanced Explanation}
Frequency is measured in hertz (Hz), where 1 Hz is one cycle per second. For larger frequencies, we use prefixes like kilo (k), mega (M), and giga (G) to represent multiples of 1000. Specifically:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 1 kHz = 1000 Hz
    \item 1 MHz = 1000 kHz = 1,000,000 Hz
    \item 1 GHz = 1000 MHz = 1,000,000,000 Hz
\end{itemize}
To convert 1,500,000 Hz to kHz, divide by 1000:
\[
1,500,000 \, \text{Hz} \div 1000 = 1500 \, \text{kHz}
\]
Thus, 1,500,000 Hz is equal to 1500 kHz.
