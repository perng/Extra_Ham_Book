Where should the negative power return of a mobile transceiver be connected in a vehicle?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item \textbf{At the 12 volt battery chassis ground}
    \item At the antenna mount
    \item To any metal part of the vehicle
    \item Through the transceiverâ€™s mounting bracket
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsubsection*{Explanation}
The negative power return of a mobile transceiver should be connected directly to the 12-volt battery chassis ground. This ensures a stable and low-resistance connection, which is crucial for proper operation and safety. Connecting it to other parts of the vehicle, such as the antenna mount or any metal part, can lead to poor grounding and potential interference issues. The mounting bracket is also not a suitable location for the negative power return as it may not provide a reliable ground connection.
