\subsection{Power Supply Rating for FM Transceiver}
\label{T4A01}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=T4A01]
Which of the following is an appropriate power supply rating for a typical 50 watt output mobile FM transceiver?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item 24.0 volts at 4 amperes
    \item 13.8 volts at 4 amperes
    \item 24.0 volts at 12 amperes
    \item \textbf{13.8 volts at 12 amperes}
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

Most mobile FM transceivers operate at a standard voltage of 13.8 volts, which is common in automotive electrical systems. To achieve a 50-watt output, the power supply must provide sufficient current. The correct answer is \textbf{D}, as 13.8 volts at 12 amperes provides the necessary power (13.8 V $\times$ 12 A = 165.6 W), which is more than enough to support the transceiver's operation, accounting for efficiency losses.
