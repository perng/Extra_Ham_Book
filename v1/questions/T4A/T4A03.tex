\subsection{DC Power Connection Wires for Transceivers}
\label{T4A03}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=T4A03]
Why are short, heavy-gauge wires used for a transceiver’s DC power connection?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item \textbf{To minimize voltage drop when transmitting}
    \item To provide a good counterpoise for the antenna
    \item To avoid RF interference
    \item All these choices are correct
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsubsection*{Explanation}
Short, heavy-gauge wires are used for a transceiver’s DC power connection primarily to minimize voltage drop when transmitting. Thicker wires (heavy-gauge) have lower resistance, which reduces the voltage drop across the wire when high current is drawn during transmission. Shorter wires further reduce resistance and voltage drop, ensuring that the transceiver receives adequate power for optimal performance.
