Where should an RF power meter be installed?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item \textbf{In the feed line, between the transmitter and antenna}
    \item At the power supply output
    \item In parallel with the push-to-talk line and the antenna
    \item In the power supply cable, as close as possible to the radio
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsubsection*{Explanation}
An RF power meter is used to measure the power output of a transmitter. To accurately measure the RF power being sent to the antenna, the meter should be installed in the feed line, between the transmitter and the antenna. This placement ensures that the meter reads the actual power being transmitted, rather than power at other points in the system.
