\subsection{PL-259 Coax Connectors}
\label{T9B07}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=T9B07]
Which of the following is true of PL-259 type coax connectors?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item They are preferred for microwave operation
    \item They are watertight
    \item \textbf{They are commonly used at HF and VHF frequencies}
    \item They are a bayonet-type connector
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsubsection*{Intuitive Explanation}
PL-259 connectors are like the Swiss Army knife of coax connectors—they’re versatile and commonly used in the HF (High Frequency) and VHF (Very High Frequency) ranges. Think of them as the go-to connector for your everyday radio needs, not for specialized tasks like microwave operation or underwater adventures.

\subsubsection*{Advanced Explanation}
The PL-259 connector, also known as the UHF connector, is widely used in amateur radio for its robustness and ease of use. It is particularly suited for HF (3-30 MHz) and VHF (30-300 MHz) frequencies due to its design, which minimizes signal loss at these ranges. While it is not ideal for microwave frequencies (where specialized connectors like N-type or SMA are preferred), it remains a staple in many radio setups. The connector is not inherently watertight, and it uses a threaded coupling mechanism rather than a bayonet-type connection.
