\label{T7A05}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=T7A05]
What is the name of a circuit that generates a signal at a specific frequency?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item Reactance modulator
    \item Phase modulator
    \item Low-pass filter
    \item \textbf{Oscillator}
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

An oscillator is a circuit that generates a periodic signal at a specific frequency. It is commonly used in radio transmitters to produce the carrier wave. The other options, such as reactance modulator, phase modulator, and low-pass filter, are not designed to generate signals at specific frequencies.
