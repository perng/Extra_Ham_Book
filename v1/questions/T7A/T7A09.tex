What is the function of the SSB/CW-FM switch on a VHF power amplifier?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item Change the mode of the transmitted signal
    \item \textbf{Set the amplifier for proper operation in the selected mode}
    \item Change the frequency range of the amplifier to operate in the proper segment of the band
    \item Reduce the received signal noise
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsubsection*{Explanation}
The SSB/CW-FM switch on a VHF power amplifier is used to configure the amplifier to operate correctly in the selected mode (SSB, CW, or FM). It does not change the mode of the transmitted signal, alter the frequency range, or reduce noise. Instead, it ensures the amplifier is optimized for the specific mode being used.
