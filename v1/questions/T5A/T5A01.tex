\subsection{Units of Electrical Current}
\label{T5A01}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=T5A01]
Electrical current is measured in which of the following units?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item Volts
    \item Watts
    \item Ohms
    \item \textbf{Amperes}
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

Electrical current is the flow of electric charge, and it is measured in amperes (A). Volts measure voltage, watts measure power, and ohms measure resistance. Therefore, the correct answer is \textbf{D}.
