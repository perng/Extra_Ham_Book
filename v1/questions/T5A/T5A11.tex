\subsection{Type of Current Flow Opposed by Resistance}
\label{T5A11}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=T5A11]
What type of current flow is opposed by resistance?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item Direct current
    \item Alternating current
    \item RF current
    \item \textbf{All these choices are correct}
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

Resistance is a property of a material that opposes the flow of electric current, regardless of the type of current. Whether it is direct current (DC), alternating current (AC), or radio frequency (RF) current, resistance will always oppose the flow. Therefore, the correct answer is that all these choices are correct.
