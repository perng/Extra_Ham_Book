What are the units of electrical resistance?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item Siemens
    \item Mhos
    \item \textbf{Ohms}
    \item Coulombs
\end{enumerate}

Electrical resistance is a measure of the opposition to the flow of electric current in a conductor. The unit of electrical resistance is the Ohm, symbolized by the Greek letter $\Omega$. This unit is named after Georg Simon Ohm, who formulated Ohm's Law, which relates voltage, current, and resistance in an electrical circuit. The other options listed are units for different electrical properties: Siemens and Mhos are units of electrical conductance, and Coulombs are units of electric charge.
