\subsubsection*{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you want to talk to your friend through a loudspeaker system, but you don't have a microphone. Instead, you use your computer to send your voice directly to the loudspeaker. EchoLink works similarlyâ€”it allows you to connect to a repeater (the loudspeaker) using the internet, so you don't need a radio to start the conversation.

\subsubsection*{Advanced Explanation}
EchoLink is a VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) system designed for amateur radio operators. It allows users to connect to repeaters or other stations via the internet, bypassing the need for a physical radio to initiate the transmission. This is particularly useful for operators who may not have access to a radio but still want to participate in repeater communications. EchoLink uses a combination of software and internet connectivity to facilitate these transmissions, making it a versatile tool in the amateur radio community.
