\subsection{Switch Type in Figure T-2}
\label{T6A12(A)}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=T6A12(A)]
What type of switch is represented by component 3 in figure T-2?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item \textbf{Single-pole single-throw}
    \item Single-pole double-throw
    \item Double-pole single-throw
    \item Double-pole double-throw
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

This question is straightforward and requires identifying the type of switch depicted in the figure. The correct answer is \textbf{Single-pole single-throw}, which is a basic switch that controls a single circuit with one input and one output.

% Diagram prompt: Generate a simple schematic diagram of a single-pole single-throw switch using SVG or any vector graphics software. The diagram should clearly show the switch in both open and closed positions, with labels for the input and output terminals.
