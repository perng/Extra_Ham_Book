    \item \textbf{Resistor}
    \item Inverter
    \item Transformer
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you're trying to push a ball through a pipe filled with sand. The sand makes it harder to push the ball through, right? In a DC circuit, a resistor acts like that sand, making it harder for the electric current to flow. It's the component that opposes the flow of current.

\subsubsection*{Advanced Explanation}
In a DC circuit, a resistor is the component that provides resistance to the flow of electric current. According to Ohm's Law, \( V = IR \), where \( V \) is the voltage, \( I \) is the current, and \( R \) is the resistance. The resistor's primary function is to limit the current flow, thereby controlling the voltage and current in the circuit. Inductors and transformers are more relevant in AC circuits, and inverters are used to convert DC to AC, making the resistor the correct answer for this question.
