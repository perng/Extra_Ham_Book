What electrical component is typically constructed as a coil of wire?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item Switch
    \item Capacitor
    \item Diode
    \item \textbf{Inductor}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Brief Explanation}
An inductor is an electrical component that stores energy in a magnetic field when electric current flows through it. It is typically constructed as a coil of wire, which enhances its ability to store magnetic energy. The other components listed (switch, capacitor, and diode) are not constructed as coils of wire and serve different functions in electrical circuits.
