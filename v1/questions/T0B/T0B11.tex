\subsection{Grounding Requirements for Amateur Radio Towers}
\label{T0B11}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=T0B11]
Which of the following establishes grounding requirements for an amateur radio tower or antenna?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item FCC Part 97 rules
    \item \textbf{Local electrical codes}
    \item FAA tower lighting regulations
    \item UL recommended practices
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsubsection*{Explanation}
The grounding requirements for an amateur radio tower or antenna are primarily governed by local electrical codes. These codes ensure that the installation is safe and meets the electrical standards set by the local authorities. While FCC Part 97 rules regulate the operation of amateur radio stations, they do not specifically address grounding requirements. Similarly, FAA tower lighting regulations focus on the visibility of towers to aircraft, and UL recommended practices are guidelines rather than mandatory codes. Therefore, the correct answer is \textbf{B: Local electrical codes}.
