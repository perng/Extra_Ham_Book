\subsection{SWR Reading Interpretation}
\label{T7C06}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=T7C06]
What does an SWR reading of 4:1 indicate?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item Loss of -4 dB
    \item Good impedance match
    \item Gain of +4 dB
    \item \textbf{Impedance mismatch}
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

An SWR (Standing Wave Ratio) reading of 4:1 indicates an impedance mismatch between the transmitter and the antenna. This means that not all the power from the transmitter is being efficiently transferred to the antenna, leading to reflected power and potential damage to the transmitter if not corrected.
