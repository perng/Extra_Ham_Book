\label{T7C09}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=T7C09]
Which of the following causes failure of coaxial cables?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item \textbf{Moisture contamination}
    \item Solder flux contamination
    \item Rapid fluctuation in transmitter output power
    \item Operation at 100\% duty cycle for an extended period
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsubsection*{Explanation}
Coaxial cables are widely used in radio technology for transmitting signals. One of the most common causes of coaxial cable failure is moisture contamination. When moisture seeps into the cable, it can degrade the dielectric material inside, leading to signal loss or complete failure. This is why it's crucial to ensure that coaxial cables are properly sealed and protected from environmental factors like rain or humidity.
