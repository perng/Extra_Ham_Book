\subsection{Disadvantages of Air Core Coaxial Cable}
\label{T7C11}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=T7C11]
What is a disadvantage of air core coaxial cable when compared to foam or solid dielectric types?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item It has more loss per foot
    \item It cannot be used for VHF or UHF antennas
    \item \textbf{It requires special techniques to prevent moisture in the cable}
    \item It cannot be used at below freezing temperatures
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

Air core coaxial cables, unlike foam or solid dielectric types, are more susceptible to moisture ingress. This necessitates the use of special techniques to prevent moisture from entering the cable, which can degrade performance and lead to signal loss. The other options are incorrect as air core coaxial cables do not inherently have more loss per foot, can be used for VHF or UHF antennas, and can be used at below freezing temperatures.
