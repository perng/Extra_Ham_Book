\subsection{Accountability for Repeater Violations}
\label{T1F10}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=T1F10]
Who is accountable if a repeater inadvertently retransmits communications that violate the FCC rules?
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*),noitemsep]
    \item \textbf{The control operator of the originating station}
    \item The control operator of the repeater
    \item The owner of the repeater
    \item Both the originating station and the repeater owner
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsubsection*{Explanation}
In the context of FCC regulations, the control operator of the originating station is responsible for ensuring that all communications comply with the rules. If a repeater retransmits a communication that violates these rules, the accountability lies with the control operator of the station that originated the communication, not the repeater or its owner. This is because the repeater is merely retransmitting the signal it receives, and the responsibility for the content of that signal rests with the originating station.
