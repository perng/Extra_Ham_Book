What should be done to all external ground rods or earth connections?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item Waterproof them with silicone caulk or electrical tape
    \item Keep them as far apart as possible
    \item \textbf{Bond them together with heavy wire or conductive strap}
    \item Tune them for resonance on the lowest frequency of operation
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

To ensure safety and proper functioning of external ground rods or earth connections, they should be bonded together with heavy wire or conductive strap. This helps in maintaining a common ground potential and reduces the risk of electrical hazards.
