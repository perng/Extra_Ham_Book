What hazard is caused by charging or discharging a battery too quickly?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item \textbf{Overheating or out-gassing}
    \item Excess output ripple
    \item Half-wave rectification
    \item Inverse memory effect
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you're trying to fill a water balloon too quickly. If you pour water in too fast, the balloon might burst or leak. Similarly, when you charge or discharge a battery too quickly, it can overheat or release gases, which can be dangerous. This is why it's important to charge batteries at the right speed.

\subsubsection*{Advanced Explanation}
When a battery is charged or discharged too quickly, the chemical reactions inside the battery occur at an accelerated rate. This can lead to several issues:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Overheating}: Rapid charging or discharging increases the internal resistance of the battery, causing it to heat up. Excessive heat can damage the battery's internal structure and reduce its lifespan.
    \item \textbf{Out-gassing}: The accelerated chemical reactions can produce gases faster than the battery can safely vent them. This can lead to pressure build-up and potentially cause the battery to swell, leak, or even explode.
\end{itemize}
To avoid these hazards, it's crucial to use chargers and discharge rates that are within the battery's specified limits.
