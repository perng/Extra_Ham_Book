\subsection{Fuse or Circuit Breaker Installation in 120V AC Power Circuit}
\label{T0A08}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=T0A08]
Where should a fuse or circuit breaker be installed in a 120V AC power circuit?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item In series with the hot conductor only
    \item In series with the hot and neutral conductors
    \item In parallel with the hot conductor only
    \item In parallel with the hot and neutral conductors
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsubsection*{Explanation}
In a 120V AC power circuit, the fuse or circuit breaker should be installed in series with the hot conductor only. This ensures that the circuit is interrupted in case of an overcurrent, protecting the wiring and devices connected to the circuit. Installing it in series with the neutral conductor is unnecessary and could lead to safety hazards. Parallel installation would not provide the necessary protection.
