What is the purpose of a fuse in an electrical circuit?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item To prevent power supply ripple from damaging a component
    \item \textbf{To remove power in case of overload}
    \item To limit current to prevent shocks
    \item All these choices are correct
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

A fuse is a safety device designed to protect an electrical circuit from damage caused by excessive current. When the current flowing through the circuit exceeds a certain threshold, the fuse blows or melts, breaking the circuit and stopping the flow of electricity. This prevents potential damage to the circuit components and reduces the risk of fire. The correct answer is \textbf{B}, as the primary purpose of a fuse is to remove power in case of an overload.
