What is an appropriate way to call another station on a repeater if you know the other station's call sign?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item Say break, break, then say the station's call sign
    \item \textbf{Say the station's call sign, then identify with your call sign}
    \item Say CQ three times, then the other station's call sign
    \item Wait for the station to call CQ, then answer
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

When calling another station on a repeater, it is important to follow proper protocol. The correct method is to first say the other station's call sign, followed by your own call sign. This ensures clarity and proper identification.
