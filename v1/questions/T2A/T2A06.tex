Which of the following is required when making on-the-air test transmissions?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item \textbf{Identify the transmitting station}

\subsubsection*{Explanation}
When making on-the-air test transmissions, it is essential to identify the transmitting station. This ensures that other operators are aware of the source of the transmission and can avoid confusion. The other options, such as conducting tests only during specific hours or notifying the FCC, are not required for on-the-air test transmissions.
