\subsection{Satellite Beacon Telemetry Information}
\label{T8B01}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=T8B01]
What telemetry information is typically transmitted by satellite beacons?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item The signal strength of received signals
    \item Time of day accurate to plus or minus 1/10 second
    \item \textbf{Health and status of the satellite}
    \item All these choices are correct
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

Satellite beacons are primarily used to transmit information about the health and status of the satellite. This helps ground stations monitor the satellite's condition and ensure it is functioning correctly. The other options, such as signal strength and precise time, are not typically the main focus of satellite beacon telemetry.
