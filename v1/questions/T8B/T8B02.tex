\subsection{Impact of Excessive Effective Radiated Power on Satellite Uplink}
\label{T8B02}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=T8B02]
What is the impact of using excessive effective radiated power on a satellite uplink?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item Possibility of commanding the satellite to an improper mode
    \item \textbf{Blocking access by other users}
    \item Overloading the satellite batteries
    \item Possibility of rebooting the satellite control computer
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

Using excessive effective radiated power (ERP) on a satellite uplink can cause significant interference, blocking access by other users. This is because the high power signal can dominate the satellite's receiver, making it difficult or impossible for other signals to be received and processed. This is a common issue in shared communication systems where multiple users rely on the same satellite for transmission.
