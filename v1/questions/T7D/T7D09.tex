\subsection{Cold Tin-Lead Solder Joint Appearance}
\label{T7D09}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=T7D09]
What is the characteristic appearance of a cold tin-lead solder joint?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item Dark black spots
    \item A bright or shiny surface
    \item \textbf{A rough or lumpy surface}
    \item Excessive solder
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

A cold solder joint occurs when the solder does not melt completely or cools too quickly, resulting in a poor electrical connection. The characteristic appearance of such a joint is a rough or lumpy surface, which indicates that the solder did not flow properly. This is why option C is the correct answer.
