\subsection{Multimeter Current Measurement Configuration}
\label{T7D03}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=T7D03]
When configured to measure current, how is a multimeter connected to a component?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item \textbf{In series}
    \item In parallel
    \item In quadrature
    \item In phase
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

To measure current, a multimeter must be connected in series with the component. This allows the current to flow through the multimeter, enabling it to measure the current accurately. Connecting it in parallel would measure voltage instead, and the other options are not relevant to current measurement.
