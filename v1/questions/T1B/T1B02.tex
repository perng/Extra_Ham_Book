\subsubsection*{Explanation}
Amateur radio operators with a Technician class license or higher are permitted to contact the International Space Station (ISS) on VHF bands. This privilege is not restricted to General class license holders, and no special approval from NASA is required. The Technician class license is the entry-level license in the United States, and it grants access to VHF frequencies, which are commonly used for satellite communications, including those with the ISS.
