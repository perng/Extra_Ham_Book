\subsection{RF Feedback Symptoms}
\label{T7B11}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=T7B11]
What is a symptom of RF feedback in a transmitter or transceiver?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item Excessive SWR at the antenna connection
    \item The transmitter will not stay on the desired frequency
    \item \textbf{Reports of garbled, distorted, or unintelligible voice transmissions}
    \item Frequent blowing of power supply fuses
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsubsection*{Explanation}
RF feedback in a transmitter or transceiver can cause interference with the transmitted signal, leading to garbled, distorted, or unintelligible voice transmissions. This occurs because the feedback loop causes the signal to interfere with itself, degrading the quality of the transmission. The other options listed are not directly related to RF feedback.
