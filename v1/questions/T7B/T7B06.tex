Which of the following actions should you take if a neighbor tells you that your stationâ€™s transmissions are interfering with their radio or TV reception?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item \textbf{Make sure that your station is functioning properly and that it does not cause interference to your own radio or television when it is tuned to the same channel}
    \item Immediately turn off your transmitter and contact the nearest FCC office for assistance
    \item Install a harmonic doubler on the output of your transmitter and tune it until the interference is eliminated
    \item All these choices are correct
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

If a neighbor reports interference from your station, the first step is to ensure your equipment is functioning correctly and not causing interference to your own devices. This is a practical and immediate action to identify and potentially resolve the issue.
