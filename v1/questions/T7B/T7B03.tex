\subsection{Radio Frequency Interference Causes}
\label{T7B03}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=T7B03]
Which of the following can cause radio frequency interference?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item Fundamental overload
    \item Harmonics
    \item Spurious emissions
    \item \textbf{All these choices are correct}
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsubsection*{Explanation}
Radio frequency interference (RFI) can be caused by various factors, including fundamental overload, harmonics, and spurious emissions. Fundamental overload occurs when a receiver is overwhelmed by a strong signal, harmonics are multiples of the fundamental frequency that can interfere with other signals, and spurious emissions are unwanted signals emitted by a transmitter. Therefore, all the listed choices are correct causes of RFI.
