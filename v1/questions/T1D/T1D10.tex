\label{T1D10}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=T1D10]
How does the FCC define broadcasting for the Amateur Radio Service?
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*),noitemsep]
    \item Two-way transmissions by amateur stations
    \item Any transmission made by the licensed station
    \item Transmission of messages directed only to amateur operators
    \item \textbf{Transmissions intended for reception by the general public}
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) defines broadcasting in the Amateur Radio Service as transmissions that are intended for reception by the general public. This distinguishes broadcasting from other types of transmissions, such as two-way communications or messages directed specifically to amateur operators.
