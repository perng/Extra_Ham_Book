\label{T8D05}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=T8D05]
Which of the following is an application of APRS?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item \textbf{Providing real-time tactical digital communications in conjunction with a map showing the locations of stations}
    \item Showing automatically the number of packets transmitted via PACTOR during a specific time interval
    \item Providing voice over internet connection between repeaters
    \item Providing information on the number of stations signed into a repeater
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

APRS (Automatic Packet Reporting System) is primarily used for real-time digital communication, often in conjunction with mapping software to display the locations of stations. This makes it particularly useful for tactical and emergency communications. The other options describe functionalities that are not typically associated with APRS.
