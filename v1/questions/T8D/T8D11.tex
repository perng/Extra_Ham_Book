What is an ARQ transmission system?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item A special transmission format limited to video signals
    \item A system used to encrypt command signals to an amateur radio satellite
    \item \textbf{An error correction method in which the receiving station detects errors and sends a request for retransmission}
    \item A method of compressing data using autonomous reiterative Q codes prior to final encoding
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you're sending a text message to a friend, but sometimes the message gets garbled. An ARQ (Automatic Repeat reQuest) system is like having your friend check the message and ask you to resend it if something doesn't make sense. It's a way to make sure the information gets through correctly without errors.

\subsubsection*{Advanced Explanation}
ARQ is a protocol used in data communication to ensure the integrity of transmitted data. When data is sent from one station to another, the receiving station checks for errors using various error detection techniques (e.g., checksums, cyclic redundancy checks). If an error is detected, the receiving station sends a request back to the transmitting station to resend the data. This process continues until the data is received correctly or a maximum number of retries is reached. ARQ is particularly useful in environments where the transmission medium is prone to errors, such as wireless communication.
