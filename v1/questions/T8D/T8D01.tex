\subsection{Digital Communications Modes}
\label{T8D01}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=T8D01]
Which of the following is a digital communications mode?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item Packet radio
    \item IEEE 802.11
    \item FT8
    \item \textbf{All these choices are correct}
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsubsection*{Intuitive Explanation}
Digital communications modes are like different languages that computers use to talk to each other. Just like you can speak English, Spanish, or French, computers can use different modes like Packet radio, IEEE 802.11, or FT8 to communicate. The question is asking which of these are digital modes, and the answer is that all of them are!

\subsubsection*{Advanced Explanation}
Digital communications modes involve the transmission of data in digital form, as opposed to analog signals. 

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Packet radio} is a digital mode where data is broken into packets and transmitted over radio frequencies.
    \item \textbf{IEEE 802.11} is a set of standards for implementing wireless local area network (WLAN) communication, commonly known as Wi-Fi, which is inherently digital.
    \item \textbf{FT8} is a popular digital mode used in amateur radio for weak signal communication, designed for efficient and reliable data transmission.
\end{itemize}

All these modes are digital, making the correct answer that all the choices are correct.
