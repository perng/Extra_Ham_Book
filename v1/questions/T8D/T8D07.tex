Which of the following describes DMR?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item \textbf{A technique for time-multiplexing two digital voice signals on a single 12.5 kHz repeater channel}
    \item An automatic position tracking mode for FM mobiles communicating through repeaters
    \item An automatic computer logging technique for hands-off logging when communicating while operating a vehicle

DMR, or Digital Mobile Radio, is a digital radio standard that allows for efficient use of the radio spectrum by time-multiplexing two digital voice signals on a single 12.5 kHz repeater channel. This technique effectively doubles the capacity of the channel, making it a popular choice for modern radio communication systems.
