\subsubsection*{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine the Earth's atmosphere as a giant, invisible pipe. Sometimes, this pipe can trap radio waves and guide them over long distances, even beyond the horizon. This phenomenon is called tropospheric ducting. Itâ€™s like a secret tunnel for radio signals, allowing them to travel much farther than they normally would. This is especially useful for VHF and UHF communications, which usually have a limited range.

\subsubsection*{Advanced Explanation}
Tropospheric ducting occurs when there is a temperature inversion in the troposphere, the lowest layer of the Earth's atmosphere. This inversion creates a boundary layer that can trap radio waves, particularly in the VHF and UHF bands. The trapped waves are then guided along this layer, allowing them to propagate over distances much greater than the line-of-sight range. This effect is most common in regions with stable weather conditions and can facilitate communications over approximately 300 miles. Other propagation mechanisms, such as D region refraction, F2 region refraction, and Faraday rotation, do not typically support such long-range VHF and UHF communications on a regular basis.
