\subsection{Type of Radiation in Radio Signals}
\label{T0C01}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=T0C01]
What type of radiation are radio signals?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item Gamma radiation
    \item Ionizing radiation
    \item Alpha radiation
    \item \textbf{Non-ionizing radiation}
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

Radio signals are a form of electromagnetic radiation, but they are not powerful enough to ionize atoms or molecules. This means they fall under the category of non-ionizing radiation, which includes other types like visible light and microwaves. Unlike ionizing radiation (e.g., gamma rays, X-rays), non-ionizing radiation does not have enough energy to remove tightly bound electrons from atoms, making it generally safer for human exposure.
