\subsection{Interference on the Same Frequency}
\label{T2B08}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=T2B08]
Which of the following applies when two stations transmitting on the same frequency interfere with each other?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item \textbf{The stations should negotiate continued use of the frequency}
    \item Both stations should choose another frequency to avoid conflict
    \item Interference is inevitable, so no action is required
    \item Use subaudible tones so both stations can share the frequency
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

When two stations transmit on the same frequency and cause interference, the appropriate action is for the stations to negotiate the continued use of the frequency. This ensures that both parties can communicate effectively without causing further disruption.
