How can you join a digital repeater’s “talkgroup”?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item Register your radio with the local FCC office
    \item Join the repeater owner’s club
    \item \textbf{Program your radio with the group’s ID or code}
    \item Sign your call after the courtesy tone
\end{enumerate}

To join a digital repeater’s talkgroup, you need to program your radio with the group’s ID or code. This allows your radio to communicate with the repeater and participate in the specific talkgroup. The other options are not relevant to joining a talkgroup on a digital repeater.
