\label{T5D07}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=T5D07]
What is the current in a circuit with an applied voltage of 120 volts and a resistance of 80 ohms?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item 9600 amperes
    \item 200 amperes
    \item 0.667 amperes
    \item \textbf{1.5 amperes}
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you have a water hose with a certain amount of water pressure (voltage) and a nozzle that restricts the flow (resistance). The amount of water flowing through the hose (current) depends on both the pressure and the size of the nozzle. In this case, with 120 volts of pressure and 80 ohms of resistance, the current is 1.5 amperes.

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
According to Ohm's Law, the current \( I \) in a circuit is given by the formula:
\[
I = \frac{V}{R}
\]
where \( V \) is the voltage and \( R \) is the resistance. Plugging in the given values:
\[
I = \frac{120 \text{ volts}}{80 \text{ ohms}} = 1.5 \text{ amperes}
\]
Thus, the correct answer is 1.5 amperes.
