In addition to frequency, which of the following is used to identify amateur radio bands?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item \textbf{The approximate wavelength in meters}
    \item Traditional letter/number designators
    \item Channel numbers
    \item All these choices are correct
\end{enumerate}

Amateur radio bands are often identified by their approximate wavelength in meters, in addition to their frequency. This is a common practice in the amateur radio community to simplify communication about different bands.
