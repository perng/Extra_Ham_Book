How much current is required to deliver 120 watts at a voltage of 12 volts DC?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item 0.1 amperes
    \item \textbf{10 amperes}
    \item 12 amperes
    \item 132 amperes
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you have a water pipe. The voltage is like the water pressure, and the current is like the flow rate of the water. If you want to deliver a certain amount of water (power), you need to adjust the flow rate (current) based on the pressure (voltage). In this case, you need to find out how much water flow (current) is needed to deliver 120 watts of power with 12 volts of pressure.

\subsubsection*{Advanced Explanation}
To determine the current required to deliver a specific amount of power at a given voltage, we use the formula:
\[
P = V \times I
\]
where \( P \) is power in watts, \( V \) is voltage in volts, and \( I \) is current in amperes. Rearranging the formula to solve for current:
\[
I = \frac{P}{V}
\]
Substituting the given values:
\[
I = \frac{120 \text{ watts}}{12 \text{ volts}} = 10 \text{ amperes}
\]
Thus, 10 amperes of current are required to deliver 120 watts at 12 volts DC.
