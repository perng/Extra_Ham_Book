What is impedance?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item \textbf{The opposition to AC current flow}
    \item The inverse of resistance
    \item The Q or Quality Factor of a component
    \item The power handling capability of a component
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

Impedance is a fundamental concept in radio technology, particularly when dealing with alternating current (AC) circuits. It represents the total opposition that a circuit presents to the flow of AC current, encompassing both resistance and reactance. This is crucial for understanding how signals behave in various components and circuits.
