\subsection{Formula for Electrical Power in a DC Circuit}
\label{T5C08}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=T5C08]
What is the formula used to calculate electrical power (P) in a DC circuit?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item \textbf{P = I E}
    \item P = E / I
    \item P = E â€“ I
    \item P = I + E
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

The formula for calculating electrical power in a DC circuit is straightforward. The correct formula is \( P = I \times E \), where \( P \) is power in watts, \( I \) is current in amperes, and \( E \) is voltage in volts. This formula is derived from the basic principles of electrical power, which states that power is the product of voltage and current.
