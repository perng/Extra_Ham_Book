\subsection{Reasons to Use Shielded Wire}
\label{T6D03}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=T6D03]
Which of the following is a reason to use shielded wire?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item To decrease the resistance of DC power connections
    \item To increase the current carrying capability of the wire
    \item \textbf{To prevent coupling of unwanted signals to or from the wire}
    \item To couple the wire to other signals
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

Shielded wire is primarily used to protect the signal carried by the wire from external electromagnetic interference (EMI) and to prevent the wire from emitting EMI that could affect other nearby wires or devices. This is achieved by surrounding the inner conductor with a conductive layer, typically made of braided wire or foil, which acts as a barrier to electromagnetic fields.
