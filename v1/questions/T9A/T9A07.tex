What is a disadvantage of using a handheld VHF transceiver with a flexible antenna inside a vehicle?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item \textbf{Signal strength is reduced due to the shielding effect of the vehicle}
    \item The bandwidth of the antenna will decrease, increasing SWR
    \item The SWR might decrease, decreasing the signal strength
    \item All these choices are correct
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

When using a handheld VHF transceiver inside a vehicle, the metal body of the vehicle acts as a shield, reducing the signal strength. This is because the metal structure of the vehicle can block or reflect radio waves, making it harder for the signal to reach the outside. This is a common issue when using portable radios in enclosed metal spaces.
