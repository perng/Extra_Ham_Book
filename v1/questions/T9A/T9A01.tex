What is a beam antenna?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item An antenna built from aluminum I-beams
    \item An omnidirectional antenna invented by Clarence Beam
    \item \textbf{An antenna that concentrates signals in one direction}
    \item An antenna that reverses the phase of received signals
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

A beam antenna is designed to focus radio signals in a specific direction, which increases the signal strength in that direction while reducing it in others. This is useful for long-distance communication where you want to maximize the signal in the direction of the receiver.
