\label{T9A09}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=T9A09]
What is the approximate length, in inches, of a half-wavelength 6 meter dipole antenna?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item 6
    \item 50
    \item \textbf{112}
    \item 236
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Intuitive Explanation}
A half-wavelength dipole antenna is designed to be half the length of the wavelength of the signal it is intended to transmit or receive. For a 6 meter wavelength, half of that is 3 meters. Converting meters to inches (since 1 meter is approximately 39.37 inches), we get roughly 118 inches. The closest option to this value is 112 inches.

\subsubsection*{Advanced Explanation}
The length of a half-wavelength dipole antenna can be calculated using the formula:
\[
\text{Length} = \frac{\lambda}{2}
\]
where \(\lambda\) is the wavelength. For a 6 meter wavelength:
\[
\text{Length} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ meters}
\]
To convert meters to inches:
\[
3 \text{ meters} \times 39.37 \text{ inches/meter} \approx 118 \text{ inches}
\]
The closest option to this calculated value is 112 inches, making it the correct answer.
