\subsection{Programming Requirements for D-STAR Transceivers}
\label{T4B11}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=T4B11]
Which of the following must be programmed into a D-STAR digital transceiver before transmitting?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item \textbf{Your call sign}
    \item Your output power
    \item The codec type being used
    \item All these choices are correct
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsubsection*{Explanation}
Before transmitting with a D-STAR digital transceiver, it is essential to program your call sign into the device. This ensures proper identification and compliance with regulatory requirements. The other options, such as output power and codec type, are typically managed automatically by the transceiver or are not mandatory for basic operation.
