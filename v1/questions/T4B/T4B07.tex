What does a DMR “code plug” contain?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item Your call sign in CW for automatic identification
    \item \textbf{Access information for repeaters and talkgroups}
    \item The codec for digitizing audio
    \item The DMR software version
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Explanation}
A DMR (Digital Mobile Radio) code plug is essentially a configuration file used to program a DMR radio. It contains all the necessary settings and information required for the radio to operate correctly. This includes access information for repeaters and talkgroups, which allows the radio to connect to specific networks and communicate with other users. The correct answer is \textbf{B}, as the code plug primarily contains access information for repeaters and talkgroups, not CW call signs, codecs, or software versions.
