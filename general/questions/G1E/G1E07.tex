\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=G1E07]
In what part of the 2.4 GHz band may an amateur station communicate with non-licensed Wi-Fi stations?
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*)]
    \item Anywhere in the band
    \item Channels 1 through 4
    \item Channels 42 through 45
    \item \textbf{No part}
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you're at a party where everyone is talking at the same time. Now, there's a rule that says you can only talk to people who are also following the same rules as you. In the 2.4 GHz band, amateur radio stations (that's you) are like the rule-following guests, and non-licensed Wi-Fi stations are like the rule-breaking guests. According to the rules, you can't talk to them at all! So, the correct answer is that you can't communicate with non-licensed Wi-Fi stations in any part of the 2.4 GHz band.

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
The 2.4 GHz band is a shared frequency spectrum used by various devices, including amateur radio stations and Wi-Fi networks. However, amateur radio operators are subject to specific regulations that restrict communication with non-licensed devices. According to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rules, amateur stations are not permitted to communicate with non-licensed Wi-Fi stations in the 2.4 GHz band. This is to prevent interference and ensure that amateur radio operations remain within the legal framework.

Mathematically, the 2.4 GHz band spans from 2.4 GHz to 2.4835 GHz. Wi-Fi channels within this band are typically allocated in 5 MHz increments, with channels 1 through 14 being the most commonly used. However, regardless of the specific channel, amateur stations are not allowed to communicate with non-licensed Wi-Fi stations.
