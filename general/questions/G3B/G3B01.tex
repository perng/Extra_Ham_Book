\label{G3B01}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=G3B01]
What is a characteristic of skywave signals arriving at your location by both short-path and long-path propagation?
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*),noitemsep]
    \item Periodic fading approximately every 10 seconds
    \item Signal strength increased by 3 dB
    \item The signal might be cancelled causing severe attenuation
    \item \textbf{A slightly delayed echo might be heard}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you’re shouting across a canyon. Your voice bounces off the walls and comes back to you at different times. Now, think of the Earth as a giant canyon, and the ionosphere as the walls. When radio signals travel through the sky, they can take different paths—some short and some long. When they arrive at your radio, the signals that took the long path might be a bit late, like a delayed echo. That’s why you might hear a slight delay in the signal!

\subsubsection*{Advanced Explanation}
Skywave propagation involves radio waves reflecting off the ionosphere, allowing them to travel beyond the horizon. When a signal is transmitted, it can take two primary paths: the short path (the most direct route) and the long path (which travels in the opposite direction around the Earth). Due to the difference in path lengths, the long-path signal arrives slightly later than the short-path signal. This time delay results in a phenomenon known as an echo. 

The delay can be calculated using the formula:
\[
\Delta t = \frac{d_{\text{long}} - d_{\text{short}}}{c}
\]
where \(d_{\text{long}}\) and \(d_{\text{short}}\) are the distances of the long and short paths, respectively, and \(c\) is the speed of light (\(3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\)).

This echo is typically very slight, often just a few milliseconds, but it can be noticeable in certain conditions. The other options, such as periodic fading or signal cancellation, are not directly related to the dual-path propagation of skywave signals.
