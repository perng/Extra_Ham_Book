\subsection{HF Propagation and LUF-MUF Relationship}
\label{G3B11}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=G3B11]
What happens to HF propagation when the LUF exceeds the MUF?  
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*,noitemsep]
    \item \textbf{Propagation via ordinary skywave communications is not possible over that path}
    \item HF communications over the path are enhanced
    \item Double-hop propagation along the path is more common
    \item Propagation over the path on all HF frequencies is enhanced
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you're trying to throw a ball (your radio signal) over a wall (the ionosphere). The LUF (Lowest Usable Frequency) is like the minimum strength you need to throw the ball over the wall, and the MUF (Maximum Usable Frequency) is like the maximum strength you can throw it without it going too far. If the LUF is higher than the MUF, it’s like saying you need more strength to throw the ball than you’re allowed to use. So, you can’t throw the ball over the wall at all! That’s why ordinary skywave communication isn’t possible in this case.

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
In HF (High Frequency) propagation, the LUF and MUF are critical parameters. The LUF is the lowest frequency at which a signal can be effectively transmitted between two points via the ionosphere, while the MUF is the highest frequency that can be used for the same purpose. When the LUF exceeds the MUF, it means that the ionospheric conditions are such that no frequency within the HF range can support skywave propagation over that path. Mathematically, this can be represented as:

\[
\text{LUF} > \text{MUF}
\]

This inequality indicates that the ionosphere cannot refract any HF signal sufficiently to maintain communication over the desired path. The ionospheric layers (D, E, and F) play a crucial role in this process. The D layer absorbs lower frequencies, while the F layer is responsible for refracting higher frequencies. When the LUF exceeds the MUF, the ionospheric conditions are unfavorable for any frequency in the HF band to be refracted effectively, rendering ordinary skywave communication impossible.
