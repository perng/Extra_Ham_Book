\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you're trying to throw a ball as far as possible. If you throw it too high, it might go out of bounds, and if you throw it too low, it won't go far enough. The sweet spot is just below the maximum height you can throw it. Similarly, in radio waves, the Maximum Usable Frequency (MUF) is like the highest point you can throw the ball. Just below the MUF, the radio waves can travel the farthest without losing too much energy, making it the best choice for long-distance communication.

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
The Maximum Usable Frequency (MUF) is the highest frequency at which a radio wave can be transmitted between two points via ionospheric reflection. Frequencies just below the MUF experience minimal attenuation because they are efficiently reflected by the ionosphere without being absorbed or scattered excessively. The MUF is influenced by factors such as solar activity, time of day, and geographic location. Mathematically, the MUF can be approximated using the formula:

\[
\text{MUF} = f_c \sec \theta
\]

where \( f_c \) is the critical frequency and \( \theta \) is the angle of incidence. Frequencies just below the MUF are optimal for long-distance skip propagation because they balance reflection efficiency and attenuation.
