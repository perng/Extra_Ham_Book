\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you have a photocopier. If you put a picture in and the copy looks exactly the same, thatâ€™s like a linear amplifier! It takes your signal (the picture) and makes a bigger version of it without changing how it looks. If the copier messed up the colors or made the picture blurry, that would be like a non-linear amplifier. So, a linear amplifier is like a perfect copier for signals!

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
A linear amplifier is designed to amplify a signal while maintaining the fidelity of the input waveform. Mathematically, if the input signal is \( x(t) \), the output signal \( y(t) \) is given by:
\[
y(t) = A \cdot x(t)
\]
where \( A \) is the amplification factor. This relationship ensures that the output is a scaled version of the input without distortion. 

Linear amplifiers are crucial in applications where signal integrity is paramount, such as in communication systems. Non-linear amplifiers, like Class C amplifiers, introduce harmonics and distortions, which are undesirable in such contexts. Frequency multipliers, on the other hand, alter the frequency of the input signal, which is not the function of a linear amplifier.
