\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=G1B04]
Which of the following transmissions is permitted for all amateur stations?
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*),noitemsep]
    \item Unidentified transmissions of less than 10 seconds duration for test purposes only
    \item Automatic retransmission of other amateur signals by any amateur station
    \item \textbf{Occasional retransmission of weather and propagation forecast information from US government stations}
    \item Encrypted messages, if not intended to facilitate a criminal act
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you're a radio operator, and you want to share some important weather updates with your fellow operators. The rules say you can't just broadcast anything you want, but there's a special exception: you're allowed to share weather and propagation forecasts from the government. Think of it like being the town crier, but for weather reports! This is a handy way to keep everyone informed without breaking any rules.

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
In the context of amateur radio regulations, certain types of transmissions are explicitly permitted under the rules set by governing bodies such as the FCC in the United States. One such permitted transmission is the occasional retransmission of weather and propagation forecast information from US government stations. This is allowed because it serves a public service function, providing valuable information to the amateur radio community and the general public.

The other options listed are not permitted for various reasons:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Unidentified transmissions, even if brief, are generally prohibited to ensure accountability and proper use of the radio spectrum.
    \item Automatic retransmission of other amateur signals can lead to interference and is not allowed without specific authorization.
    \item Encrypted messages, even if not intended for criminal purposes, are restricted to prevent misuse and ensure transparency in communications.
\end{itemize}

Therefore, the correct answer is \textbf{C}, as it aligns with the regulations that promote responsible and beneficial use of amateur radio frequencies.
