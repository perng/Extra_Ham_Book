When is it permissible to communicate with amateur stations in countries outside the areas administered by the Federal Communications Commission?
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*),noitemsep]
    \item Only when the foreign country has a formal third-party agreement filed with the FCC
    \item \textbf{When the contact is with amateurs in any country except those whose administrations have notified the ITU that they object to such communications}
    \item Only when the contact is with amateurs licensed by a country which is a member of the United Nations, or by a territory possessed by such a country
    \item Only when the contact is with amateurs licensed by a country which is a member of the International Amateur Radio Union, or by a territory possessed by such a country
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you're playing a game where you can talk to players from different countries, but there's a rule: you can't talk to players from countries that have said, No, we don't want to play with you. As long as the country hasn't said no, you're good to go! This is similar to how amateur radio operators can communicate with stations in other countries, as long as those countries haven't told the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) that they don't allow it.

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
In the context of amateur radio, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) governs communications within the United States. However, when communicating with amateur stations in other countries, the rules are influenced by international agreements. The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) is the global body that coordinates these agreements. According to ITU regulations, amateur radio operators in one country can communicate with operators in another country unless the latter's administration has formally notified the ITU of their objection to such communications. This ensures that international amateur radio communications are conducted in a manner that respects the sovereignty and regulations of each country involved.
