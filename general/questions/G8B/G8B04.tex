\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you have a toy car that can only go at a slow speed, but you want it to go super fast. Instead of building a new car, you use a magic gearbox that makes the car go faster by multiplying its speed. In a VHF FM transmitter, the magic gearbox is called a \textbf{Multiplier}. It takes a slow signal and makes it faster (or higher in frequency) so it can reach the desired operating frequency. Cool, right?

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
In VHF FM transmitters, the desired operating frequency is often much higher than the frequency of the initial signal generated by the oscillator. To achieve this, a \textbf{Multiplier} stage is used. The multiplier generates harmonics of the lower frequency signal. A harmonic is an integer multiple of the fundamental frequency. For example, if the fundamental frequency is \( f \), the second harmonic is \( 2f \), the third harmonic is \( 3f \), and so on.

Mathematically, if the oscillator generates a signal at frequency \( f \), the multiplier will produce a signal at \( nf \), where \( n \) is an integer. This allows the transmitter to reach the desired VHF frequency without needing an oscillator that operates at that high frequency directly.

The multiplier is typically implemented using non-linear devices such as diodes or transistors, which inherently generate harmonics when driven by a sinusoidal signal. The desired harmonic is then filtered out using a bandpass filter to ensure that only the required frequency is transmitted.
