\label{G8B13}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=G8B13]
Which of the following is an odd-order intermodulation product of frequencies \( F1 \) and \( F2 \)?
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*)]
    \item \( 5F1 - 3F2 \)
    \item \( 3F1 - F2 \)
    \item \( \mathbf{2F1 - F2} \)
    \item All these choices are correct
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you have two friends, \( F1 \) and \( F2 \), who are playing a game where they combine their moves. Sometimes, they create new moves that are a mix of their original ones. In this case, we're looking for a move that is odd in nature. The move \( 2F1 - F2 \) is like \( F1 \) doing two moves and \( F2 \) doing one move in the opposite direction. This combination is considered odd because it involves an odd number of steps. So, \( 2F1 - F2 \) is the odd-order intermodulation product we're looking for!

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
Intermodulation products arise when two or more frequencies mix in a nonlinear system, producing new frequencies that are sums and differences of the original frequencies. An odd-order intermodulation product is one where the sum of the coefficients of the frequencies is an odd number. 

For the given frequencies \( F1 \) and \( F2 \), let's analyze the options:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \( 5F1 - 3F2 \): The sum of the coefficients is \( 5 + 3 = 8 \), which is even.
    \item \( 3F1 - F2 \): The sum of the coefficients is \( 3 + 1 = 4 \), which is even.
    \item \( 2F1 - F2 \): The sum of the coefficients is \( 2 + 1 = 3 \), which is odd.
\end{itemize}

Thus, \( 2F1 - F2 \) is the odd-order intermodulation product.

In general, odd-order intermodulation products are significant because they can fall close to the original frequencies and cause interference in communication systems. Understanding and managing these products is crucial in designing efficient and interference-free radio systems.
