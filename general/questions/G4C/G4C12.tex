Why must all metal enclosures of station equipment be grounded?
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*,noitemsep]
    \item It prevents a blown fuse in the event of an internal short circuit
    \item It prevents signal overload
    \item It ensures that the neutral wire is grounded
    \item \textbf{It ensures that hazardous voltages cannot appear on the chassis}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine your radio equipment is like a big metal box. Now, if something goes wrong inside the box, like a wire touching the metal, it could make the whole box dangerous to touch—like a giant electric shock waiting to happen! Grounding the box is like giving that electricity a safe path to escape, so it doesn’t hurt anyone. Think of it as a superhero cape for your equipment, keeping everyone safe from nasty shocks.

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
Grounding metal enclosures is a critical safety measure in electrical systems. When equipment is grounded, any fault current (such as from a short circuit) is directed safely to the earth, preventing the buildup of hazardous voltages on the chassis. This is achieved by connecting the metal enclosure to a grounding electrode, typically via a grounding conductor. 

The principle behind this is Ohm's Law, \( V = IR \), where \( V \) is the voltage, \( I \) is the current, and \( R \) is the resistance. In a grounded system, the resistance of the grounding path is kept very low, ensuring that even if a fault occurs, the voltage on the chassis remains at a safe level. This prevents electric shock hazards and protects both the equipment and the user.

Additionally, grounding helps in stabilizing the voltage levels and provides a reference point for the electrical system, ensuring proper operation of the equipment. It also aids in the dissipation of static charges and reduces electromagnetic interference (EMI), which can affect the performance of radio equipment.
