\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=G8A06]
Which of the following is characteristic of QPSK31?
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*),noitemsep]
    \item It is sideband sensitive
    \item Its encoding provides error correction
    \item Its bandwidth is approximately the same as BPSK31
    \item \textbf{All these choices are correct}
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine QPSK31 as a super-efficient delivery truck that can carry twice as many packages as a regular truck (BPSK31) without needing a bigger road (bandwidth). Not only that, but it also has a special system to make sure none of the packages get lost (error correction) and itâ€™s really good at avoiding traffic jams (sideband sensitivity). So, QPSK31 is like the ultimate delivery truck for data!

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
QPSK31, or Quadrature Phase Shift Keying 31, is a digital modulation technique used in amateur radio. It is characterized by the following:

1. \textbf{Sideband Sensitivity}: QPSK31 is designed to be efficient in terms of bandwidth usage, making it sensitive to sideband interference but still effective in crowded frequency bands.

2. \textbf{Error Correction}: The encoding scheme of QPSK31 includes error correction capabilities, which help in reducing the error rate during data transmission.

3. \textbf{Bandwidth Efficiency}: Despite being a more complex modulation scheme than BPSK31, QPSK31 maintains a similar bandwidth. This is achieved by transmitting two bits per symbol, effectively doubling the data rate without increasing the bandwidth.

Mathematically, QPSK31 can be represented as:
\[
s(t) = A \cos(2\pi f_c t + \phi_i)
\]
where \( \phi_i \) can take on one of four possible values (0, \(\frac{\pi}{2}\), \(\pi\), \(\frac{3\pi}{2}\)), each representing a unique pair of bits.

The bandwidth \( B \) of QPSK31 is given by:
\[
B = \frac{R_s}{2}
\]
where \( R_s \) is the symbol rate. Since QPSK31 transmits two bits per symbol, its bandwidth is approximately the same as BPSK31, which transmits one bit per symbol.

% Prompt for generating a diagram: A diagram showing the phase states of QPSK31 in a constellation plot would be helpful to visualize the four possible phase shifts.
