\subsection{Characteristics of Low Voltage Ceramic Capacitors}
\label{G6A08}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=G6A08]
Which of the following is characteristic of low voltage ceramic capacitors?
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*,noitemsep]
    \item Tight tolerance
    \item High stability
    \item High capacitance for given volume
    \item \textbf{Comparatively low cost}
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you're shopping for a toy car. You have a few options: one that's super precise, one that's very stable, one that's really fast, and one that's just cheap. Now, think of low voltage ceramic capacitors like the cheap toy car. They might not be the fanciest or the most precise, but they get the job done without breaking the bank. So, when you're looking for a capacitor that's affordable, low voltage ceramic capacitors are your go-to choice!

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
Low voltage ceramic capacitors are widely used in electronic circuits due to their cost-effectiveness. These capacitors are typically made from ceramic materials, which are inexpensive to produce. The dielectric material in ceramic capacitors allows for a relatively high capacitance in a small volume, but the primary advantage is their low cost compared to other types of capacitors like electrolytic or tantalum capacitors.

The other options listed in the question refer to different characteristics:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Tight tolerance} (Option A): This refers to the precision with which the capacitance value is maintained. Ceramic capacitors generally do not have tight tolerances.
    \item \textbf{High stability} (Option B): This refers to the ability of the capacitor to maintain its capacitance over time and under varying conditions. Ceramic capacitors are not known for high stability.
    \item \textbf{High capacitance for given volume} (Option C): While ceramic capacitors do offer a good capacitance-to-volume ratio, this is not their most distinguishing feature.
    \item \textbf{Comparatively low cost} (Option D): This is the most characteristic feature of low voltage ceramic capacitors, making them a popular choice in cost-sensitive applications.
\end{itemize}

In summary, low voltage ceramic capacitors are chosen primarily for their affordability, making them a practical option for many electronic designs.
