\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you have a magical volume knob that can make sounds louder or softer without any distortion. An operational amplifier (op-amp) is like that magical knob but for electrical signals. It takes a tiny electrical signal and makes it much bigger, just like turning up the volume on your favorite song. Since it works with continuous signals (like the smooth flow of water), itâ€™s called an \textit{analog} device. So, the correct answer is \textbf{Analog}!

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
An operational amplifier (op-amp) is a high-gain electronic voltage amplifier with a differential input and, usually, a single-ended output. It is a key component in analog electronics, used in a wide range of applications such as signal conditioning, filtering, and mathematical operations (e.g., addition, subtraction, integration, and differentiation).

The op-amp operates on continuous signals, which are characteristic of analog devices. It amplifies the voltage difference between its two input terminals, producing an output voltage that is typically hundreds of thousands of times larger than the input difference. The relationship between the input and output voltages can be expressed as:

\[
V_{\text{out}} = A_{\text{OL}} \cdot (V_{+} - V_{-})
\]

where \( V_{\text{out}} \) is the output voltage, \( A_{\text{OL}} \) is the open-loop gain of the op-amp, and \( V_{+} \) and \( V_{-} \) are the voltages at the non-inverting and inverting inputs, respectively.

Op-amps are fundamental in analog circuit design due to their versatility and ability to perform a wide range of functions with minimal external components. They are used in active filters, oscillators, comparators, and many other analog circuits.
