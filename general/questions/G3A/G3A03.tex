Approximately how long does it take the increased ultraviolet and X-ray radiation from a solar flare to affect radio propagation on Earth?
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*),noitemsep]
    \item 28 days
    \item 1 to 2 hours
    \item \textbf{8 minutes}
    \item 20 to 40 hours

\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine the Sun as a giant flashlight in space. When it suddenly gets brighter (like during a solar flare), it sends out a burst of light and energy. This energy travels through space at the speed of light, which is super fast! It’s like when you turn on a flashlight and the light instantly hits the wall. The energy from the solar flare takes about 8 minutes to reach Earth, just like the light from the Sun. So, when the Sun has a sneeze (a solar flare), we feel the effects on our radios in just 8 minutes!

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
Solar flares are sudden, intense bursts of radiation from the Sun, primarily in the form of ultraviolet (UV) and X-ray radiation. These emissions travel at the speed of light, which is approximately \(3 \times 10^8\) meters per second. The average distance from the Earth to the Sun is about \(1.496 \times 10^{11}\) meters, known as one Astronomical Unit (AU).

To calculate the time it takes for the radiation to reach Earth, we use the formula:
\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
\text{Time} = \frac{1.496 \times 10^{11} \text{ m}}{3 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s}} \approx 498.67 \text{ seconds}
\]
Converting seconds to minutes:
\[
\text{Time} \approx \frac{498.67 \text{ s}}{60 \text{ s/min}} \approx 8.31 \text{ minutes}
\]
Thus, the radiation from a solar flare takes approximately 8 minutes to reach Earth. This radiation can ionize the Earth's ionosphere, affecting radio wave propagation by altering the ionospheric layers' ability to reflect or refract radio signals.
