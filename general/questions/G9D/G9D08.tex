How does a “screwdriver” mobile antenna adjust its feed point impedance?
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*)]
    \item By varying its body capacitance
    \item \textbf{By varying the base loading inductance}
    \item By extending and retracting the whip
    \item By deploying a capacitance hat
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you have a screwdriver antenna, which is like a fancy radio antenna for your car. Now, think of it as a musical instrument. Just like you can tune a guitar by tightening or loosening the strings, the screwdriver antenna tunes itself by changing something called the base loading inductance. This is like adjusting the tension in the strings to get the perfect note. So, when the antenna needs to match the radio's frequency, it tweaks this inductance to get everything in harmony. Cool, right?

\subsubsection*{Advanced Explanation}
The screwdriver antenna adjusts its feed point impedance primarily by varying the base loading inductance. This is achieved through a mechanism that changes the inductance at the base of the antenna, which in turn affects the impedance matching. The impedance \( Z \) of an antenna is given by:

\[
Z = R + jX
\]

where \( R \) is the resistance and \( X \) is the reactance. By altering the inductance \( L \) at the base, the reactance \( X \) changes according to:

\[
X = \omega L
\]

where \( \omega \) is the angular frequency of the signal. This adjustment ensures that the antenna's impedance matches the transmission line's impedance, minimizing reflections and maximizing power transfer. The screwdriver mechanism allows for precise tuning, making it highly effective for mobile operations across different frequencies.
