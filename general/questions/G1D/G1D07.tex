\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you're in school, and you have a big test coming up. The teacher is too busy to grade all the tests, so they ask some of the older students to help out. But who makes sure these older students are fair and know what they're doing? That's where the Volunteer Examiner Coordinator comes in. They're like the boss of the older students, making sure everything is done correctly. So, when the question asks who accredits Volunteer Examiners, it's the Volunteer Examiner Coordinator who gives them the thumbs up!

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
In the context of amateur radio licensing, Volunteer Examiners (VEs) are individuals authorized to administer and grade license examinations. These examiners are accredited by a Volunteer Examiner Coordinator (VEC). The VEC is an organization that coordinates the activities of VEs and ensures that the examination process adheres to the standards set by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The FCC itself does not directly accredit VEs; instead, it delegates this responsibility to VECs. This system allows for a more efficient and decentralized administration of amateur radio licensing exams.

The Universal Licensing System (ULS) and the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau are entities within the FCC that manage licensing and regulatory matters, but they do not directly accredit Volunteer Examiners. Therefore, the correct answer is that Volunteer Examiners are accredited by a Volunteer Examiner Coordinator.
