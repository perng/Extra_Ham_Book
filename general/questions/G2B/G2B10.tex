\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=G2B10]
Which of the following is good amateur practice for net management?
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*,noitemsep]
    \item Always use multiple sets of phonetics during check-in
    \item \textbf{Have a backup frequency in case of interference or poor conditions}
    \item Transmit the full net roster at the beginning of every session
    \item All these choices are correct
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you're playing a game with your friends over walkie-talkies. Suddenly, someone starts talking on the same channel, and you can't hear each other anymore. What would you do? You'd probably switch to another channel, right? That's exactly what having a backup frequency is all about! It's like having a Plan B so you can keep talking even if things get messy. The other options, like using fancy words or listing everyone's names, might be fun but aren't as important as making sure you can actually communicate.

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
In amateur radio, net management refers to the organization and coordination of communication during a scheduled on-air meeting. One of the critical aspects of effective net management is ensuring continuous communication, especially in the presence of interference or poor signal conditions. 

Having a backup frequency is a best practice because it provides an alternative communication channel if the primary frequency becomes unusable. This is particularly important in scenarios where external interference (e.g., from other radio users or environmental factors) disrupts the primary frequency. 

The other options, while they may have their place, are not as universally applicable or critical. Using multiple sets of phonetics can be helpful in ensuring clarity, but it is not a necessity for net management. Transmitting the full net roster at the beginning of every session can be inefficient and is not a standard practice. Therefore, the most effective and widely recommended practice is to have a backup frequency.
