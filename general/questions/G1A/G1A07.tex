\subsection{G1A07: Amateur Frequencies for CW Emissions in the 10-Meter Band}
\label{G1A07}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=G1A07]
On which amateur frequencies in the 10-meter band may stations with a General class control operator transmit CW emissions?
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*]
    \item 28.000 MHz to 28.025 MHz only
    \item 28.000 MHz to 28.300 MHz only
    \item 28.025 MHz to 28.300 MHz only
    \item \textbf{The entire band}
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine the 10-meter band is like a big playground, and CW (Continuous Wave) emissions are like a game of tag. If you're a General class operator, you get to play tag anywhere on the playgroundâ€”no restrictions! So, whether you're at the swings (28.000 MHz) or the slide (28.300 MHz), you can run around and have fun everywhere. That's why the correct answer is The entire band.

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
The 10-meter band spans from 28.000 MHz to 28.300 MHz. For General class operators, the FCC regulations allow CW emissions across the entire 10-meter band. This means there are no sub-band restrictions for CW emissions within this range. 

To understand this better, let's break it down:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{CW Emissions}: These are continuous wave signals, typically used for Morse code communication. They are narrowband and efficient for long-distance communication.
    \item \textbf{General Class Privileges}: Operators with a General class license have broader frequency privileges compared to Technician class operators. This includes access to the entire 10-meter band for CW emissions.
\end{itemize}

Therefore, the correct answer is \textbf{D: The entire band}.
