\label{G1C02}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=G1C02]
What is the maximum transmitter power an amateur station may use on the 12-meter band?
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*)]
    \item 50 watts PEP output
    \item 200 watts PEP output
    \item \textbf{1500 watts PEP output}
    \item An effective radiated power equivalent to 100 watts from a half-wave dipole
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you’re at a rock concert, and the band is playing on a stage. The louder they play, the more people can hear them, right? But there’s a limit to how loud they can go before it starts causing problems for the neighbors. Similarly, when you’re using a radio on the 12-meter band, you can crank up the power to make your signal travel farther, but there’s a maximum limit to how much power you can use. In this case, the maximum power you’re allowed to use is 1500 watts PEP output. Think of it as the “volume knob” for your radio, and 1500 watts is the highest setting you’re allowed to use without getting into trouble.

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
The maximum transmitter power allowed for an amateur station on the 12-meter band is governed by regulatory bodies such as the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in the United States. The 12-meter band falls within the High Frequency (HF) range, specifically from 24.89 MHz to 24.99 MHz. The power limit is set to ensure that amateur radio operators do not cause harmful interference to other users of the radio spectrum.

The correct answer is \textbf{1500 watts PEP output}. PEP stands for Peak Envelope Power, which is the maximum power that occurs during the transmission of a signal. This limit is set to balance the need for effective communication with the need to minimize interference.

To calculate the effective radiated power (ERP), which is another way to measure the power output, you would need to consider the antenna gain. The formula for ERP is:

\[
\text{ERP} = P_{\text{transmitter}} \times G_{\text{antenna}}
\]

where \( P_{\text{transmitter}} \) is the transmitter power and \( G_{\text{antenna}} \) is the antenna gain. However, the question specifically asks for the maximum transmitter power, not the ERP, so the correct answer is 1500 watts PEP output.
