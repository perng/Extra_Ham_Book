What frequency range is referred to as UHF?
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*)]
    \item 30 to 300 kHz
    \item 30 to 300 MHz
    \item 300 to 3000 kHz
    \item \textbf{300 to 3000 MHz}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you're tuning your radio to find your favorite station. If you go really high up the dial, you're entering the UHF zone! UHF stands for Ultra High Frequency, and it's like the high-speed lane for radio waves. It's where you find things like TV channels, walkie-talkies, and even some Wi-Fi signals. So, if someone asks you about UHF, just remember it's the super-fast, high-frequency range from 300 to 3000 MHz. It's like the sports car of radio frequencies!

\subsubsection*{Advanced Explanation}
The Ultra High Frequency (UHF) range is a segment of the radio frequency spectrum that spans from 300 MHz to 3000 MHz. This range is particularly important in telecommunications because it allows for higher bandwidth and shorter wavelengths, which are ideal for applications like television broadcasting, mobile phones, and satellite communication.

Mathematically, the frequency \( f \) in Hertz (Hz) is related to the wavelength \( \lambda \) in meters (m) by the equation:
\[
f = \frac{c}{\lambda}
\]
where \( c \) is the speed of light in a vacuum, approximately \( 3 \times 10^8 \) meters per second. For UHF, the wavelengths range from 1 meter (at 300 MHz) to 0.1 meters (at 3000 MHz).

The UHF band is divided into several sub-bands, each allocated for specific uses. For example, the 470-862 MHz range is commonly used for television broadcasting, while the 2.4 GHz band is used for Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. Understanding these allocations is crucial for designing and operating communication systems efficiently.
