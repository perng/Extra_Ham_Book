What frequency range is referred to as HF?
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*)]
    \item 300 to 3000 MHz
    \item 30 to 300 MHz
    \item \textbf{3 to 30 MHz}

\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine the radio spectrum as a giant music keyboard. Each key represents a different frequency range. The HF (High Frequency) range is like the middle section of the keyboard—not too high, not too low. It’s the sweet spot where signals can bounce off the Earth’s atmosphere and travel long distances. So, when someone says HF, they’re talking about frequencies from 3 to 30 MHz—just the right pitch for long-distance communication!

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
The High Frequency (HF) band spans from 3 to 30 MHz. This range is particularly significant in radio communication because it allows for skywave propagation, where signals are reflected off the ionosphere, enabling long-distance communication. The ionosphere is a layer of the Earth's atmosphere that is ionized by solar radiation, and it can reflect HF signals back to the Earth's surface.

Mathematically, the relationship between frequency \( f \) and wavelength \( \lambda \) is given by:
\[
\lambda = \frac{c}{f}
\]
where \( c \) is the speed of light (\( 3 \times 10^8 \) m/s). For the HF range (3 to 30 MHz), the corresponding wavelengths are:
\[
\lambda = \frac{3 \times 10^8}{3 \times 10^6} = 100 \text{ m} \quad \text{to} \quad \lambda = \frac{3 \times 10^8}{30 \times 10^6} = 10 \text{ m}
\]
These wavelengths are ideal for ionospheric reflection, making HF a crucial band for global communication, especially in areas where other forms of communication are impractical.
