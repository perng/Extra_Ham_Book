\subsection{Converting Frequency to Wavelength}
\label{T3B06}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=T3B06]
What is the formula for converting frequency to approximate wavelength in meters?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item Wavelength in meters equals frequency in hertz multiplied by 300
    \item Wavelength in meters equals frequency in hertz divided by 300
    \item Wavelength in meters equals frequency in megahertz divided by 300
    \item \textbf{Wavelength in meters equals 300 divided by frequency in megahertz}
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

To convert frequency to wavelength, the formula is straightforward. The wavelength (\(\lambda\)) in meters is approximately equal to 300 divided by the frequency (\(f\)) in megahertz (MHz). This is because the speed of light is approximately \(3 \times 10^8\) meters per second, and frequency in MHz is \(10^6\) hertz. Therefore, the formula simplifies to \(\lambda = \frac{300}{f}\).
