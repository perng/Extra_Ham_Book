\subsection{Circuit Indicated by Black Wire Insulation}
\label{T0A03}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=T0A03]
In the United States, what circuit does black wire insulation indicate in a three-wire 120 V cable?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item Neutral
    \item \textbf{Hot}
    \item Equipment ground
    \item Black insulation is never used
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Intuitive Explanation}
Think of the black wire as the energized wire in your household electrical system. It's the one that carries the electrical current from the power source to your devices. If you were to touch it (which you should never do!), you'd get a shock because it's hot with electricity.

\subsubsection*{Advanced Explanation}
In a standard three-wire 120 V AC electrical system in the United States, the black wire is designated as the hot wire. This wire carries the current from the power source to the load (e.g., a light bulb or an appliance). The other wires in the cable are typically white (neutral) and green or bare (ground). The neutral wire completes the circuit by providing a return path for the current, while the ground wire is a safety feature that provides a path to earth in case of a fault. The black wire's insulation color is standardized to indicate its role as the hot wire, ensuring consistency and safety in electrical installations.
