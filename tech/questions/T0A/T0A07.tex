\subsection{Lightning Arrester Installation in Coaxial Feed Line}
\label{T0A07}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=T0A07]
Where should a lightning arrester be installed in a coaxial feed line?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item At the output connector of a transceiver
    \item At the antenna feed point
    \item At the ac power service panel
    \item \textbf{On a grounded panel near where feed lines enter the building}
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

A lightning arrester should be installed on a grounded panel near where feed lines enter the building to protect the equipment from lightning-induced surges. This placement ensures that any lightning strike is safely diverted to the ground before it can reach and damage the transceiver or other sensitive equipment.
