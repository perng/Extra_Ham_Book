\subsection{Fuse Replacement Safety}
\label{T0A05}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=T0A05]
Why should a 5-ampere fuse never be replaced with a 20-ampere fuse?
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*]
    \item The larger fuse would be likely to blow because it is rated for higher current
    \item The power supply ripple would greatly increase
    \item \textbf{Excessive current could cause a fire}
    \item All these choices are correct
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine your fuse is like a guard dog. A 5-ampere fuse is a small dog that barks loudly if someone tries to sneak in too much electricity. If you replace it with a 20-ampere fuse, it's like getting a big, lazy dog that doesn't bark even if a whole gang of electricity tries to break in. This could lead to too much electricity flowing through your wires, making them hot enough to start a fire. So, always use the right-sized guard dog for your electrical system!

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
A fuse is designed to protect electrical circuits by breaking the circuit when the current exceeds a specified value. The 5-ampere fuse is rated to blow (i.e., break the circuit) when the current exceeds 5 amperes. If a 20-ampere fuse is used instead, the circuit will not break until the current exceeds 20 amperes. This can lead to excessive current flowing through the circuit, which can cause overheating and potentially start a fire.

The relationship between current, resistance, and power is given by the formula:
\[ P = I^2 R \]
where \( P \) is the power dissipated as heat, \( I \) is the current, and \( R \) is the resistance of the circuit. If the current \( I \) increases, the power \( P \) increases quadratically, leading to a significant rise in heat generation. This can cause the insulation on wires to melt and ignite, resulting in a fire.

Therefore, replacing a 5-ampere fuse with a 20-ampere fuse is dangerous because it allows excessive current to flow, increasing the risk of fire. Always use the correct fuse rating to ensure the safety of your electrical system.
