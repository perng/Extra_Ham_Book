Which of the following precautions should be taken when measuring high voltages with a voltmeter?
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*]
    \item Ensure that the voltmeter has very low impedance
    \item \textbf{Ensure that the voltmeter and leads are rated for use at the voltages to be measured}
    \item Ensure that the circuit is grounded through the voltmeter
    \item Ensure that the voltmeter is set to the correct frequency
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you're trying to measure how much water is flowing through a giant pipe. You wouldn't use a tiny straw, right? You'd need a tool that can handle the pressure and volume of water. Similarly, when measuring high voltages, you need a voltmeter and leads that can handle the high voltage without breaking or causing a dangerous situation. Think of it as using the right-sized tool for the job!

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
When measuring high voltages, it is crucial to ensure that the voltmeter and its leads are rated for the voltages being measured. This is because high voltages can cause insulation breakdown, arcing, or even damage to the equipment if the components are not designed to handle such levels. The voltmeter's impedance, while important, is not the primary concern here; the focus is on the voltage rating. 

The voltage rating of a voltmeter and its leads indicates the maximum voltage they can safely measure without risk of failure. Using equipment rated below the voltage being measured can lead to catastrophic failures, including electrical arcing, which can cause injury or damage to the equipment. 

Additionally, grounding the circuit through the voltmeter (Choice C) is not a standard practice and can introduce measurement errors or safety hazards. The frequency setting (Choice D) is irrelevant when measuring DC or low-frequency AC voltages, but it is not the primary concern for high-voltage measurements.

In summary, the correct precaution is to ensure that the voltmeter and leads are rated for the voltages to be measured, as this directly addresses the safety and accuracy of the measurement.
