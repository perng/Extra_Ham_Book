What should be done to all external ground rods or earth connections?
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*]
    \item Waterproof them with silicone caulk or electrical tape
    \item Keep them as far apart as possible
    \item \textbf{Bond them together with heavy wire or conductive strap}
    \item Tune them for resonance on the lowest frequency of operation
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you have a bunch of friends who are all trying to hold onto a giant balloon. If theyâ€™re all holding onto different parts of the balloon, it might float away. But if they all hold onto the same rope tied to the balloon, they can keep it steady. Ground rods are like those friends, and the heavy wire or conductive strap is the rope that keeps them all connected. This way, they work together to keep everything safe and grounded.

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
In electrical systems, grounding is crucial for safety and proper operation. External ground rods or earth connections must be bonded together to ensure they are at the same electrical potential. This prevents potential differences that could lead to dangerous voltages or interference. Bonding is typically done using heavy gauge wire or conductive straps, which provide a low-resistance path for electrical currents. The bonding ensures that all grounding points are effectively connected, creating a unified grounding system. This is particularly important in radio frequency (RF) systems to avoid ground loops and ensure proper signal integrity.
