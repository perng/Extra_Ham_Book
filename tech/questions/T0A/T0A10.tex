What hazard is caused by charging or discharging a battery too quickly?
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*)]
    \item \textbf{Overheating or out-gassing}
    \item Excess output ripple
    \item Half-wave rectification
    \item Inverse memory effect
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you're trying to fill a water balloon too fast. What happens? It might burst or leak, right? Similarly, when you charge or discharge a battery too quickly, it can get too hot or even release gas, which is not good for the battery or you. It's like the battery is saying, Hey, slow down! I can't handle this speed!

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
When a battery is charged or discharged too quickly, the internal resistance of the battery causes heat to build up. This is described by the equation:
\[
P = I^2 R
\]
where \( P \) is the power dissipated as heat, \( I \) is the current, and \( R \) is the internal resistance of the battery. If the current \( I \) is too high, the power \( P \) increases significantly, leading to overheating. Additionally, rapid charging or discharging can cause chemical reactions within the battery to occur too quickly, leading to out-gassing, where gases are released from the battery. This can be dangerous as it may lead to swelling, leakage, or even explosion in extreme cases.

Understanding the internal resistance and the chemical processes within the battery is crucial for safe battery management. Always follow the manufacturer's guidelines for charging and discharging rates to avoid these hazards.
