What is a good way to guard against electrical shock at your station?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item Use three-wire cords and plugs for all AC powered equipment
    \item Connect all AC powered station equipment to a common safety ground
    \item Install mechanical interlocks in high-voltage circuits
    \item \textbf{All these choices are correct}
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

To guard against electrical shock at your station, it is important to follow multiple safety measures. Using three-wire cords and plugs ensures that equipment is properly grounded. Connecting all AC powered station equipment to a common safety ground helps prevent potential differences that could lead to shocks. Installing mechanical interlocks in high-voltage circuits adds an extra layer of safety by preventing accidental contact with high voltage. Therefore, all the provided choices are correct and should be implemented to ensure safety.
