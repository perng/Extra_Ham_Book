\label{T1E09}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=T1E09]
Which of the following are required for remote control operation?
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*)]
    \item The control operator must be at the control point
    \item A control operator is required at all times
    \item The control operator must indirectly manipulate the controls
    \item \textbf{All these choices are correct}
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you're playing a video game where you control a robot from your couch. To make sure the robot does what you want, you need to follow some rules. First, you don't have to be right next to the robot; you can control it from your couch. Second, you need to be paying attention the whole time the robot is moving. Lastly, you're not directly touching the robot; you're using a controller to tell it what to do. All these rules are important to make sure the robot doesn't go rogue!

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
Remote control operation in radio technology involves several key requirements to ensure proper and safe operation. First, the control operator does not need to be physically present at the control point; they can operate the equipment from a remote location. Second, a control operator must be actively monitoring and managing the operation at all times to ensure compliance with regulations and safety standards. Third, the control operator must manipulate the controls indirectly, typically through a remote interface or control system. These requirements collectively ensure that remote control operations are conducted responsibly and effectively.
