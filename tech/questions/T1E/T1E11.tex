Who does the FCC presume to be the control operator of an amateur station, unless documentation to the contrary is in the station records?
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*,noitemsep]
    \item The station custodian
    \item The third party participant
    \item The person operating the station equipment
    \item \textbf{The station licensee}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you have a cool treehouse, and you’re the boss of it. Even if your friends come over and play in it, everyone knows it’s YOUR treehouse. The FCC (the rule-makers for radio stuff) thinks the same way about amateur radio stations. Unless there’s a note saying someone else is in charge, they assume the person who owns the station (the station licensee) is the one calling the shots. So, even if someone else is playing with the radio, the owner is still the boss!

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
In the context of amateur radio operations, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has specific regulations regarding the control operator of a station. The control operator is the person responsible for ensuring that the station operates in compliance with FCC rules. According to FCC regulations, the control operator is presumed to be the station licensee unless there is documented evidence indicating otherwise. This presumption is in place to ensure accountability and proper operation of the station.

The station licensee is the individual or entity that holds the license for the amateur station. This license grants them the authority to operate the station and ensures they are knowledgeable about the rules and regulations governing amateur radio. Even if another individual is physically operating the equipment, the licensee remains the presumed control operator unless explicit documentation designates another person as the control operator.

This regulation underscores the importance of maintaining accurate station records and ensuring that all operators are aware of their responsibilities. It also highlights the licensee's ultimate responsibility for the station's compliance with FCC rules.
