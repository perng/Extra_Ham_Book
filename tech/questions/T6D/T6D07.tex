\subsection{Common Visual Indicator}
\label{T6D07}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=T6D07]
Which of the following is commonly used as a visual indicator?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item \textbf{LED}
    \item FET
    \item Zener diode
    \item Bipolar transistor
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

An LED (Light Emitting Diode) is a semiconductor device that emits light when an electric current passes through it. It is widely used as a visual indicator in various electronic devices due to its efficiency, durability, and low power consumption. The other options, FET (Field-Effect Transistor), Zener diode, and Bipolar transistor, are not typically used for visual indication.
