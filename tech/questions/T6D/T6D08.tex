\subsection{Resonant Circuit Components}
\label{T6D08}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=T6D08]
Which of the following is combined with an inductor to make a resonant circuit?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item Resistor
    \item Zener diode
    \item Potentiometer
    \item \textbf{Capacitor}
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

A resonant circuit is formed by combining an inductor with a capacitor. This combination allows the circuit to resonate at a specific frequency, which is determined by the values of the inductor and capacitor. The other components listed (resistor, Zener diode, and potentiometer) do not contribute to the resonance in the same way.
