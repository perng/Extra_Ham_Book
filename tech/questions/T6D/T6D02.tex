What is a relay?  
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*)]
    \item \textbf{An electrically-controlled switch}
    \item A current controlled amplifier
    \item An inverting amplifier
    \item A pass transistor
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine a relay as a tiny robot that flips a switch for you. You tell the robot what to do by sending it a small electric signal, and it does the heavy lifting of turning something on or off. Itâ€™s like having a helper who listens to your command and then does the job for you, but instead of using muscles, it uses electricity!

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
A relay is an electromechanical device that functions as an electrically-controlled switch. It consists of a coil, an armature, and a set of contacts. When an electric current flows through the coil, it generates a magnetic field that moves the armature, thereby opening or closing the contacts. This allows the relay to control a larger electrical circuit with a smaller signal. 

Mathematically, the operation of a relay can be described by the relationship between the input current \( I \) and the magnetic force \( F \) generated by the coil, which is given by:
\[ F = k \cdot I \]
where \( k \) is a constant that depends on the coil's properties. When \( F \) exceeds a certain threshold, the armature moves, changing the state of the contacts.

Relays are widely used in applications where it is necessary to control a high-power circuit with a low-power signal, such as in automation systems, automotive electronics, and industrial machinery.
