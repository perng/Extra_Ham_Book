Which of the following is an important safety precaution to observe when putting up an antenna tower?
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*)]
    \item Wear a ground strap connected to your wrist at all times
    \item Insulate the base of the tower to avoid lightning strikes
    \item \textbf{Look for and stay clear of any overhead electrical wires}
    \item All these choices are correct
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you're building a giant metal stick (the antenna tower) in your backyard. Now, think about the power lines above your house. If your metal stick touches those power lines, it’s like poking a sleeping dragon—it’s going to wake up and zap you! So, the smartest thing to do is to look up and make sure your metal stick stays far away from those power lines. That way, you can keep building your tower without turning into a human lightning bolt!

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
When erecting an antenna tower, one of the most critical safety precautions is to ensure that the tower does not come into contact with overhead electrical wires. This is because the high voltage carried by these wires can cause severe electrical shock or even fatal injuries. The electrical potential difference between the wires and the ground can be in the range of thousands of volts, which can easily arc through the air or conductive materials like metal towers.

The correct answer, \textbf{C}, emphasizes the importance of visual inspection and maintaining a safe distance from overhead electrical wires. This precaution is grounded in the principles of electrical safety, which dictate that any conductive structure must be kept at a safe distance from high-voltage lines to prevent accidental contact.

Additionally, while grounding and insulation are important aspects of tower safety, they do not replace the need for visual clearance checks. Grounding helps to dissipate static charges and lightning strikes, but it does not protect against direct contact with live electrical wires. Similarly, insulating the base of the tower does not prevent the tower from becoming a conductor if it comes into contact with overhead wires.

In summary, the primary safety measure when erecting an antenna tower is to ensure that it remains clear of overhead electrical wires, thereby minimizing the risk of electrical hazards.
