\subsection{Safety When Climbing a Tower}\label{T0B03}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=T0B03]
Under what circumstances is it safe to climb a tower without a helper or observer?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item When no electrical work is being performed
    \item When no mechanical work is being performed
    \item When the work being done is not more than 20 feet above the ground
    \item \textbf{Never}
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsubsection*{Explanation}
Climbing a tower is inherently risky due to the height and potential hazards such as electrical equipment, mechanical components, and environmental factors. Safety protocols, including having a helper or observer, are essential to mitigate these risks. The correct answer emphasizes that it is never safe to climb a tower without a helper or observer, regardless of the circumstances. This ensures that assistance is immediately available in case of an emergency.
