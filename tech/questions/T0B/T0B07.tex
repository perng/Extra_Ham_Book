\subsection{Safety Rules for Crank-Up Towers}
\label{T0B07}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=T0B07]
Which of the following is an important safety rule to remember when using a crank-up tower?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item This type of tower must never be painted
    \item This type of tower must never be grounded
    \item \textbf{This type of tower must not be climbed unless it is retracted, or mechanical safety locking devices have been installed}
    \item All these choices are correct
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

When using a crank-up tower, it is crucial to ensure that the tower is either fully retracted or that mechanical safety locking devices are in place before climbing. This prevents the tower from collapsing or extending unexpectedly, which could lead to serious injury or death. The other options, such as not painting or grounding the tower, are not relevant safety concerns for crank-up towers.
