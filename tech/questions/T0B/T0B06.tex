\subsection{Minimum Safe Distance from Power Lines for Antenna Installation}
\label{T0B06}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=T0B06]
What is the minimum safe distance from a power line to allow when installing an antenna?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item Add the height of the antenna to the height of the power line and multiply by a factor of 1.5
    \item The height of the power line above ground
    \item 1/2 wavelength at the operating frequency
    \item \textbf{Enough so that if the antenna falls, no part of it can come closer than 10 feet to the power wires}
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

When installing an antenna, it is crucial to maintain a safe distance from power lines to prevent accidents. The correct answer ensures that even if the antenna falls, it will not come within 10 feet of the power wires, reducing the risk of electrical hazards.
