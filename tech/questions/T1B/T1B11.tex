What is the maximum peak envelope power output for Technician class operators in their HF band segments?
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*,noitemsep]
    \item \textbf{200 watts}
    \item 100 watts
    \item 50 watts
    \item 10 watts

\subsubsection*{Intuitive Explanation}
Think of peak envelope power (PEP) as the maximum power your radio can output when it's really pushing the signal. For Technician class operators, the FCC has set a limit on how much power you can use on the HF bands. This is to ensure that everyone gets a fair chance to communicate without causing interference. The maximum PEP allowed is 200 watts. So, if you're a Technician class operator, you can use up to 200 watts of power on the HF bands, but no more!

\subsubsection*{Advanced Explanation}
Peak Envelope Power (PEP) is the maximum power level that occurs during a single cycle of a modulated signal. For Technician class operators, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulates the maximum PEP output to ensure efficient use of the radio spectrum and to minimize interference. According to FCC rules, the maximum PEP output for Technician class operators in their HF band segments is 200 watts. This limit is designed to balance the need for effective communication with the need to prevent excessive power usage that could disrupt other users of the spectrum.
