\subsection{US Amateurs in Secondary Band Segments}
\label{T1B08}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=T1B08]
How are US amateurs restricted in segments of bands where the Amateur Radio Service is secondary?
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*),noitemsep]
    \item \textbf{U.S. amateurs may find non-amateur stations in those segments, and must avoid interfering with them}
    \item U.S. amateurs must give foreign amateur stations priority in those segments
    \item International communications are not permitted in those segments
    \item Digital transmissions are not permitted in those segments
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsubsection*{Explanation}
In segments of the radio spectrum where the Amateur Radio Service is designated as a secondary user, U.S. amateurs must be cautious. The primary users of these segments have priority, and amateurs must ensure they do not cause interference to these non-amateur stations. This means that while amateurs can operate in these segments, they must yield to primary users and avoid any actions that could disrupt their communications.
