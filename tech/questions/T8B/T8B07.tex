What is Doppler shift in reference to satellite communications?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item A change in the satellite orbit
    \item A mode where the satellite receives signals on one band and transmits on another
    \item \textbf{An observed change in signal frequency caused by relative motion between the satellite and Earth station}
    \item A special digital communications mode for some satellites
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you're standing by the side of a road, and a car is speeding towards you while honking its horn. As the car gets closer, the sound of the horn seems to get higher in pitch. Once the car passes you and moves away, the pitch of the horn seems to drop. This change in pitch is similar to what happens with radio signals in satellite communications due to the Doppler shift. When a satellite is moving towards or away from an Earth station, the frequency of the signal changes slightly, just like the pitch of the car's horn.

\subsubsection*{Advanced Explanation}
The Doppler shift, or Doppler effect, is a phenomenon where the frequency of a wave changes for an observer moving relative to the wave source. In satellite communications, the relative motion between the satellite and the Earth station causes a shift in the frequency of the transmitted signal. If the satellite is moving towards the Earth station, the frequency increases (blue shift). Conversely, if the satellite is moving away, the frequency decreases (red shift). This effect is crucial for accurately receiving and interpreting signals in satellite communication systems, as it can impact the tuning and synchronization of the receiving equipment.

% Diagram Prompt: Generate a diagram showing a satellite moving towards and away from an Earth station, with arrows indicating the direction of motion and the corresponding frequency shifts (blue shift for approaching, red shift for receding). Use Python with Matplotlib for the diagram.
