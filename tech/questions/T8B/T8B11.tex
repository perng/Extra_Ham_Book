Who may receive telemetry from a space station?
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
    \item \textbf{Anyone}
    \item A licensed radio amateur with a transmitter equipped for interrogating the satellite
    \item A licensed radio amateur who has been certified by the protocol developer
    \item A licensed radio amateur who has registered for an access code from AMSAT
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you have a toy car that sends out signals about how fast it's going or how much battery it has left. Now, think of a space station as a giant toy car in the sky. The telemetry is like those signals, telling us how the space station is doing. The cool part? Anyone with the right tools (like a radio) can listen to these signals! You don’t need a special license or permission. It’s like tuning into your favorite radio station—anyone can do it!

\subsubsection*{Advanced Explanation}
Telemetry from a space station involves the transmission of data such as operational status, environmental conditions, and other metrics. This data is typically broadcasted in a way that allows it to be received by anyone with the appropriate receiving equipment. The key concept here is that telemetry is generally transmitted in an open format, meaning it is not encrypted or restricted to specific users. 

In the context of amateur radio, space stations often operate under Part 97 of the FCC regulations, which govern amateur radio activities. These regulations do not restrict the reception of telemetry data to licensed operators only. Therefore, anyone with the necessary receiving equipment, such as a radio receiver tuned to the appropriate frequency, can receive and decode the telemetry data.

This open access is crucial for educational purposes, scientific research, and fostering public interest in space exploration. It allows enthusiasts, researchers, and the general public to engage with space technology without the need for specialized certifications or access codes.
