Which of the following actions should you take if a neighbor tells you that your station’s transmissions are interfering with their radio or TV reception?
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*)]
    \item \textbf{Make sure that your station is functioning properly and that it does not cause interference to your own radio or television when it is tuned to the same channel}
    \item Immediately turn off your transmitter and contact the nearest FCC office for assistance
    \item Install a harmonic doubler on the output of your transmitter and tune it until the interference is eliminated
    \item All these choices are correct
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you’re playing music on your stereo, and your neighbor complains that it’s messing up their TV show. The first thing you’d do is check if your stereo is working right and see if it’s also messing up your own TV. If it’s not, then maybe the problem isn’t your stereo. This is like checking your radio station to make sure it’s not causing the interference. If your own TV is fine, then the issue might be something else, like their TV or the signal in the area.

\subsubsection*{Advanced Explanation}
When dealing with interference complaints, the first step is to ensure that your station is operating within legal limits and is not generating spurious emissions. This involves verifying that your equipment is functioning correctly and that it does not cause interference to your own radio or television when tuned to the same channel. This step is crucial because it helps isolate the source of the interference. If your own equipment is not affected, the issue might be due to other factors such as the neighbor’s receiver sensitivity, local signal conditions, or external noise sources. 

Additionally, it’s important to understand the concept of harmonics and spurious emissions. Harmonics are multiples of the fundamental frequency that can cause interference if not properly filtered. A harmonic doubler, mentioned in option C, is not a standard solution and could potentially exacerbate the problem. The correct approach is to ensure that your transmitter is compliant with regulations and to use appropriate filtering to minimize unwanted emissions.
