What should you do if something in a neighbor’s home is causing harmful interference to your amateur station?
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*)]
    \item Work with your neighbor to identify the offending device
    \item Politely inform your neighbor that FCC rules prohibit the use of devices that cause interference
    \item Make sure your station meets the standards of good amateur practice

\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine your neighbor’s new gadget is messing up your radio signals. What do you do? First, don’t panic! You can team up with your neighbor to figure out what’s causing the trouble. Maybe it’s their fancy new blender or a faulty device. Next, you can politely remind them that there are rules against using devices that mess with radio signals. Finally, double-check that your own radio setup is up to snuff. If you do all these things, you’re golden!

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
When harmful interference occurs, it’s essential to approach the situation methodically. First, collaborate with your neighbor to identify the source of the interference. This could involve systematically turning off devices to isolate the culprit. Second, inform your neighbor about FCC regulations under Part 15, which state that devices must not cause harmful interference and must accept any interference received. Third, ensure your amateur station complies with good amateur practices, such as proper grounding and shielding, to minimize susceptibility to interference. By addressing all these aspects, you can effectively mitigate the issue.
