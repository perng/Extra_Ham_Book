\subsection{FM Repeater Audio Distortion}
\label{T7B10}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=T7B10]
What might be a problem if you receive a report that your audio signal through an FM repeater is distorted or unintelligible?
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*]
    \item Your transmitter is slightly off frequency
    \item Your batteries are running low
    \item You are in a bad location
    \item \textbf{All these choices are correct}
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you're trying to talk to your friend through a walkie-talkie, but they keep saying, What? I can't hear you! This could happen for a few reasons. Maybe your walkie-talkie isn't tuned to the right channel (like being slightly off frequency), or the batteries are dying, making your voice sound weak. Or maybe you're in a spot with bad reception, like behind a big hill. All these things can make your message hard to understand. So, if someone says your signal is garbled, it could be any of these reasonsâ€”or even all of them!

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
In FM (Frequency Modulation) communication, several factors can lead to distorted or unintelligible audio signals:

1. \textbf{Frequency Offset (Choice A):} If your transmitter is slightly off frequency, the receiver may not correctly demodulate the signal, leading to distortion. The frequency deviation must be within the receiver's acceptable range for clear audio.

2. \textbf{Low Battery (Choice B):} Low battery levels can cause insufficient power to the transmitter, resulting in a weak signal. This can lead to poor signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), making the audio difficult to understand.

3. \textbf{Poor Location (Choice C):} Being in a bad location, such as behind obstacles or in areas with high interference, can attenuate the signal or introduce multipath distortion. This can cause the received signal to be weak or corrupted.

Mathematically, the received signal \( S_r \) can be expressed as:
\[ S_r = S_t \cdot H + N \]
where \( S_t \) is the transmitted signal, \( H \) is the channel response, and \( N \) is the noise. If \( H \) is poor due to frequency offset, low power, or bad location, \( S_r \) will be distorted.

All these factors can independently or collectively contribute to the distortion of the audio signal, making choice D the correct answer.
