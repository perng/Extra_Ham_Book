What should be the first step to resolve non-fiber optic cable TV interference caused by your amateur radio transmission?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item Add a low-pass filter to the TV antenna input
    \item Add a high-pass filter to the TV antenna input
    \item Add a preamplifier to the TV antenna input
    \item \textbf{Be sure all TV feed line coaxial connectors are installed properly}
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsubsection*{Explanation}
The first step in resolving interference issues is to ensure that all connections are properly installed. Loose or improperly installed coaxial connectors can lead to signal leakage and interference. Once the connections are verified, additional measures like filters or amplifiers can be considered if necessary.
