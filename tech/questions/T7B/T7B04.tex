\subsection{Curing Distorted Audio from RF Current}
\label{T7B04}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=T7B04]
Which of the following could you use to cure distorted audio caused by RF current on the shield of a microphone cable?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item Band-pass filter
    \item Low-pass filter
    \item Preamplifier
    \item \textbf{Ferrite choke}
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsubsection*{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine your microphone cable is like a garden hose, and RF current is like water leaking out where it shouldn't. This leakage causes the audio to sound distorted, like static on a radio. A ferrite choke acts like a clamp on the hose, stopping the leak and cleaning up the sound.

\subsubsection*{Advanced Explanation}
RF current on the shield of a microphone cable can induce unwanted noise into the audio signal, leading to distortion. A ferrite choke is a passive device that suppresses high-frequency noise by absorbing RF energy. It works by increasing the impedance of the cable at RF frequencies, effectively blocking the RF current from entering the audio circuit. This is a common and effective solution for mitigating RF interference in audio equipment.
