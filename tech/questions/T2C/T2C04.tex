\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you're in a big city, and suddenly, a huge storm hits, knocking out all the phones and internet. Everyone is panicking, and no one knows what to do. But wait! There's a group of superheroes with walkie-talkies who can still communicate. These superheroes are part of RACES. They use their special radios to help coordinate rescue efforts and keep everyone safe during emergencies. So, RACES is like the emergency communication team that steps in when everything else fails.

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
RACES, which stands for Radio Amateur Civil Emergency Service, is a part of the FCC's Part 97 rules governing amateur radio services. It is specifically designed for civil defense communications during national emergencies. RACES operators are licensed amateur radio operators who volunteer their time and equipment to assist in emergency communications when normal communication systems are unavailable.

The service is activated by local, state, or federal authorities during disasters or other emergencies. RACES operators can communicate on designated frequencies and are often integrated into the emergency management structure. They provide critical communication links for coordinating relief efforts, disseminating information, and ensuring public safety.

In summary, RACES is a vital component of the national emergency response infrastructure, leveraging the skills and resources of amateur radio operators to maintain communication during crises.
