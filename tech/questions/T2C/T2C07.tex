Which of the following is standard practice when you participate in a net?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item When first responding to the net control station, transmit your call sign, name, and address as in the FCC database
    \item Record the time of each of your transmissions
    \item \textbf{Unless you are reporting an emergency, transmit only when directed by the net control station}
    \item All these choices are correct
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

When participating in a net, it is essential to follow the instructions of the net control station to maintain order and efficiency. Transmitting only when directed, unless reporting an emergency, ensures smooth communication and prevents unnecessary interruptions.
