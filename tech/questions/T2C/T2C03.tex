What technique is used to ensure that voice messages containing unusual words are received correctly?
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*)]
    \item Send the words by voice and Morse code
    \item Speak very loudly into the microphone
    \item \textbf{Spell the words using a standard phonetic alphabet}
    \item All these choices are correct
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you're trying to tell your friend the name of a super rare Pokémon, like Xerneas. If you just say it, they might hear Zerneas or Sernias because it’s not a common word. To make sure they get it right, you spell it out using a phonetic alphabet: X as in X-ray, E as in Echo, R as in Romeo, and so on. This way, even if the word is unusual, your friend can piece it together correctly. It’s like giving them a cheat sheet for understanding tricky words!

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
In radio communication, ensuring the accurate transmission of unusual or complex words is crucial. The standard phonetic alphabet, such as the NATO phonetic alphabet, is employed to spell out words letter by letter. This alphabet assigns a specific word to each letter (e.g., Alpha for A, Bravo for B) to minimize ambiguity. 

For example, if the word Xerneas needs to be transmitted, it would be spelled as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item X as in X-ray
    \item E as in Echo
    \item R as in Romeo
    \item N as in November
    \item E as in Echo
    \item A as in Alpha
    \item S as in Sierra
\end{itemize}

This method ensures that each letter is clearly understood, reducing the likelihood of misinterpretation. The phonetic alphabet is particularly useful in noisy environments or when dealing with non-native speakers, as it provides a standardized way to convey letters unambiguously.
