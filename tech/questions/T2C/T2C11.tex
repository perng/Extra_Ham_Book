What is meant by “check” in a radiogram header?  
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]  
    \item \textbf{The number of words or word equivalents in the text portion of the message}  
    \item The call sign of the originating station  
    \item A list of stations that have relayed the message  
    \item A box on the message form that indicates that the message was received and/or relayed  
\end{enumerate}  
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}  
Imagine you’re sending a text message to your friend, but instead of using a phone, you’re using a radio. Now, before you send the message, you want to make sure your friend knows how many words you’re sending so they can check if they received everything correctly. That’s what the “check” in a radiogram header is! It’s like saying, “Hey, this message has 10 words, so count them to make sure you got them all!” Simple, right?

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}  
In radio communication, a radiogram is a formal message format used to ensure clarity and accuracy. The “check” in the header is a critical component that specifies the number of words or word equivalents in the text portion of the message. This serves as a verification tool for the receiving station to confirm that the entire message has been transmitted and received without omissions.  

For example, if a message contains 15 words, the “check” value would be 15. The receiving station can then count the words in the received message and compare it to the “check” value. If the numbers match, the message is considered complete. This process helps maintain the integrity of communication, especially in scenarios where messages may be relayed through multiple stations or transmitted under challenging conditions.  

Mathematically, if \( W \) represents the number of words in the message, the “check” value \( C \) is given by:  
\[ C = W \]  
This straightforward relationship ensures that both the sender and receiver are aligned on the message’s length, minimizing errors in transmission.
