\subsection{Accessing a Repeater}
\label{T2B04}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=T2B04]
Which of the following could be the reason you are unable to access a repeater whose output you can hear?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item Improper transceiver offset
    \item You are using the wrong CTCSS tone
    \item You are using the wrong DCS code
    \item \textbf{All these choices are correct}
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsubsection*{Explanation}
If you can hear the repeater's output but cannot access it, the issue could be due to an improper transceiver offset, an incorrect CTCSS tone, or an incorrect DCS code. All these factors are essential for proper communication with a repeater, and any one of them being incorrect can prevent access. Therefore, the correct answer is that all these choices are correct.
