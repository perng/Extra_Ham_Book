\label{T2B09}

Why are simplex channels designated in the VHF/UHF band plans?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item \textbf{So stations within range of each other can communicate without tying up a repeater}
    \item For contest operation
    \item For working DX only
    \item So stations with simple transmitters can access the repeater without automated offset
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

Simplex channels in the VHF/UHF band plans are designated to allow direct communication between stations within range of each other, without the need for a repeater. This helps to reduce the load on repeaters and ensures efficient use of the available spectrum.
