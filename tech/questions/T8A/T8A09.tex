\label{T8A09}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=T8A09]
What is the approximate bandwidth of a VHF repeater FM voice signal?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item Less than 500 Hz
    \item About 150 kHz
    \item \textbf{Between 10 and 15 kHz}
    \item Between 50 and 125 kHz
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

The bandwidth of a VHF repeater FM voice signal is typically between 10 and 15 kHz. This range is sufficient to carry the voice signal with good fidelity while efficiently using the available spectrum.
