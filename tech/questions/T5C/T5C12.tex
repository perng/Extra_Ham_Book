What is impedance?  
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*)]
    \item \textbf{The opposition to AC current flow}
    \item The inverse of resistance
    \item The Q or Quality Factor of a component
    \item The power handling capability of a component
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you're trying to push a shopping cart through a crowded mall. The people in the mall are like the obstacles that make it harder for you to move the cart. In the world of electricity, impedance is like those people—it’s what makes it harder for alternating current (AC) to flow through a circuit. It’s not just about how much the circuit resists the current (that’s resistance), but also how the circuit reacts to the changing direction of AC. So, impedance is the total pushback against AC current.

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
Impedance, denoted by \( Z \), is a complex quantity that represents the total opposition a circuit offers to the flow of alternating current (AC). It is a combination of resistance \( R \) and reactance \( X \), where reactance is the opposition due to inductance \( L \) and capacitance \( C \). Mathematically, impedance is expressed as:

\[
Z = R + jX
\]

Here, \( j \) is the imaginary unit, and \( X \) can be either inductive reactance \( X_L = 2\pi fL \) or capacitive reactance \( X_C = \frac{1}{2\pi fC} \), where \( f \) is the frequency of the AC signal. The magnitude of impedance is given by:

\[
|Z| = \sqrt{R^2 + X^2}
\]

Impedance is crucial in analyzing AC circuits because it determines how much current will flow for a given voltage. Unlike resistance, which is the same for both AC and DC, impedance varies with frequency due to the reactive components.
