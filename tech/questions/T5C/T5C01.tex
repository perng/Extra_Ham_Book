What describes the ability to store energy in an electric field?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item Inductance
    \item Resistance
    \item Tolerance
    \item \textbf{Capacitance}
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

Capacitance is the property of a system that allows it to store energy in an electric field. This is typically achieved through the use of capacitors, which consist of two conductive plates separated by an insulating material. When a voltage is applied across the plates, an electric field is created, and energy is stored in this field.
