\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you have a super cool walkie-talkie, and you want to send your voice to your friend who’s on the other side of the playground. But here’s the thing: your voice can’t just fly through the air by itself. It needs a ride! That’s where the RF carrier signal comes in. Think of it like a magic carpet that carries your voice across the playground. The process of putting your voice onto this magic carpet is called \textit{modulation}. It’s like strapping your voice onto the carpet so it can zoom over to your friend. So, when you’re talking into the walkie-talkie, you’re actually modulating your voice onto the RF carrier signal. Cool, right?

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
In radio communication, the process of combining an information signal (such as speech) with a radio frequency (RF) carrier signal is known as \textit{modulation}. Modulation is essential because the information signal, which typically has a low frequency, cannot be transmitted efficiently over long distances without a carrier signal. The carrier signal is a high-frequency wave that acts as a medium for the information signal.

There are several types of modulation techniques, including:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Amplitude Modulation (AM)}: The amplitude of the carrier signal is varied in proportion to the information signal.
    \item \textbf{Frequency Modulation (FM)}: The frequency of the carrier signal is varied in proportion to the information signal.
    \item \textbf{Phase Modulation (PM)}: The phase of the carrier signal is varied in proportion to the information signal.
\end{itemize}

Mathematically, for a simple AM signal, the modulated signal \( s(t) \) can be represented as:
\[
s(t) = A_c \left[1 + m \cdot x(t)\right] \cos(2\pi f_c t)
\]
where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( A_c \) is the amplitude of the carrier signal,
    \item \( m \) is the modulation index,
    \item \( x(t) \) is the information signal,
    \item \( f_c \) is the frequency of the carrier signal.
\end{itemize}

This equation shows how the information signal \( x(t) \) is combined with the carrier signal to produce the modulated signal \( s(t) \). The modulation index \( m \) determines the extent to which the carrier signal is modulated by the information signal.

In summary, modulation is the key process that allows us to transmit information over radio waves by combining it with a carrier signal. This is why the correct answer to the question is \textit{Modulation}.
