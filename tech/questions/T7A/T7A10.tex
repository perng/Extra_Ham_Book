\subsection{Device to Increase Transmitted Power}
\label{T7A10}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=T7A10]
What device increases the transmitted output power from a transceiver?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item A voltage divider
    \item \textbf{An RF power amplifier}
    \item An impedance network
    \item All these choices are correct
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsubsection*{Explanation}
An RF power amplifier is specifically designed to increase the power of a radio frequency signal before it is transmitted. This is essential for ensuring that the signal can travel the necessary distance to reach its destination. A voltage divider reduces voltage, and an impedance network is used to match impedances, not to increase power. Therefore, the correct answer is \textbf{B}.
