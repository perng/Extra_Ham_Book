Where is an RF preamplifier installed?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item \textbf{Between the antenna and receiver}
    \item At the output of the transmitter power amplifier
    \item Between the transmitter and the antenna tuner
    \item At the output of the receiver audio amplifier
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

The RF preamplifier is installed between the antenna and the receiver to amplify weak signals received by the antenna before they are processed by the receiver. This helps in improving the signal-to-noise ratio and overall reception quality.
