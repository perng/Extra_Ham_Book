What is a transceiver?
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*)]
    \item \textbf{A device that combines a receiver and transmitter}
    \item A device for matching feed line impedance to 50 ohms
    \item A device for automatically sending and decoding Morse code
    \item A device for converting receiver and transmitter frequencies to another band
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you have a walkie-talkie. You can use it to talk to your friend and also listen to what they say. A transceiver is like a super fancy walkie-talkie! It’s a single device that can both send (transmit) and receive messages. So, instead of needing two separate gadgets, you just need one. Cool, right?

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
A transceiver is an electronic device that integrates both a transmitter and a receiver in a single unit. The transmitter converts information into a signal that can be sent over a communication channel, while the receiver does the opposite—it takes the incoming signal and converts it back into usable information. 

Mathematically, the transmitter can be represented as a function \( T(x) \) that takes an input signal \( x \) and outputs a modulated signal \( y \). The receiver can be represented as a function \( R(y) \) that takes the modulated signal \( y \) and outputs the original signal \( x \). In a transceiver, these functions are combined into a single device, allowing for bidirectional communication.

The key advantage of a transceiver is its compactness and efficiency, as it eliminates the need for separate transmitter and receiver units. This is particularly important in applications like radio communication, where space and power are often limited.
