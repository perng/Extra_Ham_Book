To obtain a club station license grant, the club must meet specific requirements. One of these requirements is that the club must have at least four members. This ensures that the club has a sufficient number of participants to operate the station effectively. The other options, such as the trustee having an Amateur Extra Class license or the club being registered with the American Radio Relay League, are not mandatory for the issuance of a club station license grant.
