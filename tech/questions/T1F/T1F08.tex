What is the definition of third party communications?
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*]
    \item \textbf{A message from a control operator to another amateur station control operator on behalf of another person}
    \item Amateur radio communications where three stations are in communications with one another
    \item Operation when the transmitting equipment is licensed to a person other than the control operator
    \item Temporary authorization for an unlicensed person to transmit on the amateur bands for technical experiments
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you have a friend who wants to send a message to another friend, but they don’t have a walkie-talkie. You, being the awesome friend with a walkie-talkie (amateur radio), step in and send the message for them. That’s third party communication! You’re the middle person helping out. It’s like being the messenger in a game of telephone, but with radios.

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
Third party communications in amateur radio refer to the scenario where a licensed control operator transmits a message on behalf of a third party who is not directly involved in the communication. This is a common practice in amateur radio, especially during emergencies or public service events. The key points to understand are:

1. \textbf{Control Operator}: The person who is licensed to operate the amateur radio station.
2. \textbf{Third Party}: The person on whose behalf the message is being sent.
3. \textbf{Amateur Station}: The radio station involved in the communication.

The control operator ensures that the message complies with the regulations and is transmitted correctly. This type of communication is essential in situations where the third party may not have the necessary equipment or license to communicate directly.
