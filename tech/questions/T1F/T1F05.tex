What method of call sign identification is required for a station transmitting phone signals?
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*),noitemsep]
    \item Send the call sign followed by the indicator RPT
    \item \textbf{Send the call sign using a CW or phone emission}
    \item Send the call sign followed by the indicator R
    \item Send the call sign using only a phone emission
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsubsection*{Explanation}
When transmitting phone signals, a station must identify itself by sending its call sign. This can be done using either Continuous Wave (CW) or phone emission. The correct method is to send the call sign using a CW or phone emission, as specified in option B. This ensures proper identification regardless of the emission type used for the transmission.
