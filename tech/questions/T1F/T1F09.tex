\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=T1F09]
What type of amateur station simultaneously retransmits the signal of another amateur station on a different channel or channels?
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*,noitemsep]
    \item Beacon station
    \item Earth station
    \item \textbf{Repeater station}
    \item Message forwarding station
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsubsection*{Explanation}
A repeater station is designed to receive a signal on one frequency and simultaneously retransmit it on another frequency. This allows for extended communication range by overcoming obstacles like terrain or distance. The other options do not perform this specific function.
