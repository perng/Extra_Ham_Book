What can cause erratic changes in SWR?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item Local thunderstorm
    \item \textbf{Loose connection in the antenna or feed line}
    \item Over-modulation
    \item Overload from a strong local station
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

Erratic changes in SWR (Standing Wave Ratio) are often caused by physical issues in the antenna system. A loose connection in the antenna or feed line can disrupt the signal flow, leading to inconsistent SWR readings. This is a common issue that can be easily fixed by checking and securing all connections.
