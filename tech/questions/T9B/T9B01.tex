What is a benefit of low SWR?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item Reduced television interference
    \item \textbf{Reduced signal loss}
    \item Less antenna wear
    \item All these choices are correct
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

Low SWR (Standing Wave Ratio) is crucial in radio communications because it indicates how well the antenna is matched to the transmission line. When the SWR is low, it means that most of the transmitted power is being radiated by the antenna rather than being reflected back, which reduces signal loss. This is why option B is the correct answer.
