What is standing wave ratio (SWR)?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item \textbf{A measure of how well a load is matched to a transmission line}
    \item The ratio of amplifier power output to input
    \item The transmitter efficiency ratio
    \item An indication of the quality of your stationâ€™s ground connection
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you're trying to push a swing. If you push at just the right time, the swing goes higher and higher with each push. But if you push at the wrong time, the swing doesn't go as high, and some of your effort is wasted. In radio terms, the swing is like the signal traveling along a transmission line, and your push is like the signal trying to move from the transmitter to the antenna. The Standing Wave Ratio (SWR) tells you how well your push (the signal) is matching the swing (the transmission line and antenna). If the SWR is low, it means the signal is moving smoothly, like a well-timed push. If the SWR is high, it means there's a mismatch, and some of the signal is bouncing back, like a poorly timed push.

\subsubsection*{Advanced Explanation}
The Standing Wave Ratio (SWR) is a critical parameter in radio frequency (RF) engineering that quantifies the impedance matching between a transmission line and its load (typically an antenna). When the impedance of the load matches the characteristic impedance of the transmission line, maximum power is transferred, and the SWR is 1:1. However, if there is a mismatch, some of the power is reflected back towards the source, creating standing waves along the transmission line. The SWR is defined as the ratio of the maximum voltage (or current) to the minimum voltage (or current) along the line. Mathematically, it is expressed as:

\[
\text{SWR} = \frac{V_{\text{max}}}{V_{\text{min}}} = \frac{1 + |\Gamma|}{1 - |\Gamma|}
\]

where \(\Gamma\) is the reflection coefficient, which depends on the impedance mismatch. A high SWR indicates a significant mismatch, leading to power loss and potential damage to the transmitter. Therefore, maintaining a low SWR is essential for efficient RF transmission.
