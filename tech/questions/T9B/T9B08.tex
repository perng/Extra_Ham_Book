\subsection{Coaxial Feed Line Loss Sources}
\label{T9B08}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=T9B08]
Which of the following is a source of loss in coaxial feed line?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item Water intrusion into coaxial connectors
    \item High SWR
    \item Multiple connectors in the line
    \item \textbf{All these choices are correct}
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsubsection*{Explanation}
All the listed choices are indeed sources of loss in coaxial feed lines. Water intrusion can cause corrosion and signal degradation, high SWR (Standing Wave Ratio) indicates impedance mismatches that lead to power loss, and multiple connectors introduce additional points of potential signal loss. Therefore, the correct answer is \textbf{D: All these choices are correct}.
