\label{T9B03}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=T9B03]
Why is coaxial cable the most common feed line for amateur radio antenna systems?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item \textbf{It is easy to use and requires few special installation considerations}
    \item It has less loss than any other type of feed line
    \item It can handle more power than any other type of feed line
    \item It is less expensive than any other type of feed line
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

Coaxial cable is widely used in amateur radio antenna systems primarily because of its ease of use and minimal installation requirements. While other types of feed lines may offer advantages in specific areas such as lower loss or higher power handling, coaxial cable strikes a balance between performance and practicality, making it the most common choice for amateur radio operators.
