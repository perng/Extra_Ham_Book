\label{T9B02}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=T9B02]
What is the most common impedance of coaxial cables used in amateur radio?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item 8 ohms
    \item \textbf{50 ohms}
    \item 600 ohms
    \item 12 ohms
\end{enumerate}

Coaxial cables are widely used in amateur radio for transmitting signals. The impedance of a coaxial cable is a measure of how much the cable resists the flow of electrical energy. The most common impedance for coaxial cables in amateur radio is 50 ohms, which is a standard that balances signal loss and power handling capabilities. This makes option B the correct answer.
