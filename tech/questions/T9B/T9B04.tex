What is the major function of an antenna tuner (antenna coupler)?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item \textbf{It matches the antenna system impedance to the transceiver's output impedance}
    \item It helps a receiver automatically tune in weak stations
    \item It allows an antenna to be used on both transmit and receive
    \item It automatically selects the proper antenna for the frequency band being used
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

The primary function of an antenna tuner is to ensure that the impedance of the antenna system matches the output impedance of the transceiver. This matching is crucial for efficient power transfer and minimizing signal reflection, which can lead to poor performance and potential damage to the equipment.
