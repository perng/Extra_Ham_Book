\subsection{RF Connector Types for High Frequencies}
\label{T9B06}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=T9B06]
Which of the following RF connector types is most suitable for frequencies above 400 MHz?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item UHF (PL-259/SO-239)
    \item \textbf{Type N}
    \item RS-213
    \item DB-25
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsubsection*{Explanation}
The question asks about the most suitable RF connector type for frequencies above 400 MHz. The correct answer is Type N, which is designed to handle higher frequencies efficiently. UHF connectors, while commonly used, are not ideal for frequencies above 400 MHz due to their design limitations. RS-213 and DB-25 connectors are not typically used for RF applications at such high frequencies. Type N connectors are preferred for their robust construction and ability to maintain signal integrity at higher frequencies.
