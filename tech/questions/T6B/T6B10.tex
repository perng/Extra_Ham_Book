\subsection{Power Gain Devices}
\label{T6B10}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=T6B10]
Which of the following can provide power gain?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item Transformer
    \item \textbf{Transistor}
    \item Reactor
    \item Resistor
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsubsection*{Explanation}
A transistor is a semiconductor device that can amplify or switch electronic signals and electrical power. It provides power gain by controlling a larger current or voltage with a smaller input signal. In contrast, a transformer changes the voltage level but does not provide power gain, a reactor (inductor) stores energy in a magnetic field, and a resistor dissipates energy as heat. Therefore, the correct answer is \textbf{B: Transistor}.
