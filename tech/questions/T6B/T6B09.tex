What are the names for the electrodes of a diode?
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*]
    \item Plus and minus
    \item Source and drain
    \item \textbf{Anode and cathode}
    \item Gate and base
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine a diode as a one-way street for electricity. Just like a street has an entrance and an exit, a diode has two special parts called electrodes. The entrance is called the \textbf{anode}, and the exit is called the \textbf{cathode}. So, when electricity wants to go through the diode, it has to enter through the anode and leave through the cathode. If it tries to go the other way, the diode says, No way, buddy! and blocks it. It's like a bouncer at a club, only letting the right people in and out.

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
A diode is a semiconductor device that allows current to flow in one direction only. It consists of two electrodes: the \textbf{anode} and the \textbf{cathode}. The anode is the positive electrode, and the cathode is the negative electrode. When a forward bias is applied (positive voltage to the anode and negative voltage to the cathode), the diode conducts current. Conversely, when a reverse bias is applied, the diode blocks current flow.

The behavior of a diode can be described by the Shockley diode equation:
\[
I = I_S \left( e^{\frac{V}{nV_T}} - 1 \right)
\]
where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( I \) is the diode current,
    \item \( I_S \) is the saturation current,
    \item \( V \) is the voltage across the diode,
    \item \( n \) is the ideality factor (typically between 1 and 2),
    \item \( V_T \) is the thermal voltage, given by \( V_T = \frac{kT}{q} \), where \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant, \( T \) is the temperature in Kelvin, and \( q \) is the charge of an electron.
\end{itemize}

Understanding the roles of the anode and cathode is crucial for analyzing and designing circuits that involve diodes, such as rectifiers, voltage regulators, and signal demodulators.
