\subsection{LED Light Emission}
\label{T6B07}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=T6B07]
What causes a light-emitting diode (LED) to emit light?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item \textbf{Forward current}
    \item Reverse current
    \item Capacitively-coupled RF signal
    \item Inductively-coupled RF signal
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

An LED emits light when it is forward-biased, meaning that a forward current is applied. This current allows electrons to recombine with holes within the device, releasing energy in the form of photons, which we perceive as light.
