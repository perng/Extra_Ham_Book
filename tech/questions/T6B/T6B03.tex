\subsection{Electronic Switch Components}
\label{T6B03}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=T6B03]
Which of these components can be used as an electronic switch?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item Varistor
    \item Potentiometer
    \item \textbf{Transistor}
    \item Thermistor
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsubsection*{Explanation}
A transistor is a semiconductor device that can act as an electronic switch, allowing or blocking the flow of current based on the input signal. This makes it a fundamental component in digital circuits and amplifiers. The other components listed—varistor, potentiometer, and thermistor—are not designed to function as switches. A varistor is used for voltage protection, a potentiometer is a variable resistor, and a thermistor changes resistance with temperature.
