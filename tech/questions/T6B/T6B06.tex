\subsection{Cathode Lead Marking on Semiconductor Diodes}
\label{T6B06}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=T6B06]
How is the cathode lead of a semiconductor diode often marked on the package?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item With the word cathode
    \item \textbf{With a stripe}
    \item With the letter C
    \item With the letter K
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

The cathode lead of a semiconductor diode is typically marked with a stripe on the package. This is a standard industry practice to help identify the polarity of the diode.
