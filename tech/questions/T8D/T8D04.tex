What type of transmission is indicated by the term NTSC?  
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*)]
    \item A Normal Transmission mode in Static Circuit
    \item A special mode for satellite uplink
    \item \textbf{An analog fast-scan color TV signal}
    \item A frame compression scheme for TV signals
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you’re watching an old-school TV show from the 1980s. The colors are bright, the picture is clear, and everything looks smooth. That’s because the TV is using something called NTSC. It’s like a recipe for how the TV should show colors and pictures. So, when someone says NTSC, they’re talking about the way old TVs used to show colorful shows. It’s not about satellites or compressing pictures—it’s all about making sure the TV shows the right colors at the right time!

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
NTSC stands for National Television System Committee, and it refers to the analog television system used primarily in North America, Japan, and some other countries. The NTSC standard defines how analog color television signals are transmitted and displayed. It uses a specific method to encode color information into the video signal, which is then decoded by the television receiver to produce a color image.

The NTSC system operates at a frame rate of approximately 29.97 frames per second (fps) and uses a 525-line resolution. The color information is encoded using a technique called quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM), which combines the luminance (brightness) and chrominance (color) signals into a single composite signal. This composite signal is then transmitted over the airwaves or through cables to the television receiver.

The key aspect of NTSC is that it is an analog system, meaning that the signal is continuous and not digitized. This is in contrast to modern digital television standards like ATSC (Advanced Television Systems Committee), which use digital signals to transmit video and audio.

In summary, NTSC is an analog fast-scan color TV signal, and it was the standard for television broadcasting in many parts of the world before the transition to digital television.
