What is a “talkgroup” on a DMR repeater?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item A group of operators sharing common interests
    \item \textbf{A way for groups of users to share a channel at different times without hearing other users on the channel}
    \item A protocol that increases the signal-to-noise ratio when multiple repeaters are linked together
    \item A net that meets at a specified time
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

A talkgroup on a DMR repeater is a method for multiple users to share a single channel without interfering with each other. This allows different groups to communicate on the same frequency at different times, ensuring that only the intended group hears the transmission.
