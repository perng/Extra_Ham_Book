\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you’re sending secret messages to your friend using a flashlight. You turn it on and off in a specific pattern to spell out words. That’s kind of like what CW is! CW stands for Continuous Wave, but in the radio world, it’s just a fancy way of saying Morse code. Instead of a flashlight, radio operators use beeps (short and long signals) to send messages. So, CW is like the radio version of your flashlight Morse code!

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
CW, or Continuous Wave, refers to a method of radio transmission where a continuous sinusoidal wave is modulated to carry information. In the context of amateur radio, CW is synonymous with Morse code transmission. Morse code encodes characters as sequences of dots (short signals) and dashes (long signals), which are transmitted by turning the carrier wave on and off. 

Mathematically, a CW signal can be represented as:
\[
s(t) = A \cos(2\pi f_c t + \phi)
\]
where \( A \) is the amplitude, \( f_c \) is the carrier frequency, and \( \phi \) is the phase. The modulation is achieved by keying the transmitter on and off, effectively creating a binary signal (on/off) that represents the Morse code.

CW is highly efficient in terms of bandwidth and power, making it a preferred mode for long-distance communication, especially in conditions where signal strength is weak. It requires minimal bandwidth compared to other modulation techniques, which is why it remains popular among amateur radio operators.
