\label{T5A12}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=T5A12]
What describes the number of times per second that an alternating current makes a complete cycle?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item Pulse rate
    \item Speed
    \item Wavelength
    \item \textbf{Frequency}
\end{enumerate}

The question asks about the term that describes how many complete cycles an alternating current (AC) completes in one second. The correct answer is \textbf{Frequency}, which is measured in Hertz (Hz). Frequency is a fundamental concept in AC circuits and radio technology, indicating how often the current changes direction per second.
