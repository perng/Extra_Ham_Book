\subsection{Electrical Power Measurement}
\label{T5A02}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=T5A02]
Electrical power is measured in which of the following units?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item Volts
    \item \textbf{Watts}
    \item Watt-hours
    \item Amperes
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

Electrical power is the rate at which electrical energy is transferred by an electric circuit. The standard unit for measuring electrical power is the \textbf{Watt} (W). This unit is named after the Scottish engineer James Watt, who made significant contributions to the development of the steam engine. 

Volts measure electrical potential difference, Watt-hours measure energy (power over time), and Amperes measure electrical current. Therefore, the correct answer is \textbf{B: Watts}.
