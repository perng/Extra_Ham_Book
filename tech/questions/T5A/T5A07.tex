\subsection{Conductivity of Metals}
\label{T5A07}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=T5A07]
Why are metals generally good conductors of electricity?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item They have relatively high density
    \item \textbf{They have many free electrons}
    \item They have many free protons
    \item All these choices are correct
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

Metals are good conductors of electricity because they have many free electrons that can move easily through the material, allowing the flow of electric current. This is a fundamental property of metals that makes them essential in electrical wiring and components.
