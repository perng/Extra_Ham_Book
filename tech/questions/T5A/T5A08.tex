\subsection{Good Electrical Insulator}
\label{T5A08}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=T5A08]
Which of the following is a good electrical insulator?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item Copper
    \item \textbf{Glass}
    \item Aluminum
    \item Mercury
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

A good electrical insulator is a material that does not allow electric current to flow through it easily. Among the choices, glass is the best insulator because it has very high resistance to the flow of electric current. Copper, aluminum, and mercury are all conductors, meaning they allow electric current to flow through them easily.
