What factors affect the RF exposure of people near an amateur station antenna?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item Frequency and power level of the RF field
    \item Distance from the antenna to a person
    \item Radiation pattern of the antenna
    \item \textbf{All these choices are correct}

\subsubsection*{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you're standing near a giant speaker at a concert. The closer you are, the louder it sounds, right? Now, think of the antenna as that speaker, but instead of sound, it's sending out radio waves. The volume (or intensity) of these waves depends on how powerful the antenna is, how far you are from it, and the direction it's pointing. All these factors together determine how much RF exposure you get.

\subsubsection*{Advanced Explanation}
RF exposure near an amateur station antenna is influenced by several key factors:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Frequency and Power Level}: Higher frequencies and power levels generally result in greater RF exposure. The power density of the RF field increases with both frequency and transmitted power.
    \item \textbf{Distance from the Antenna}: The intensity of the RF field decreases with the square of the distance from the antenna. This means that doubling the distance reduces the exposure to one-fourth of its original value.
    \item \textbf{Radiation Pattern}: The antenna's radiation pattern determines how RF energy is distributed in space. An antenna with a focused beam will have higher exposure in the direction of the beam compared to an omnidirectional antenna.
\end{itemize}
All these factors collectively determine the RF exposure levels for individuals near the antenna.
