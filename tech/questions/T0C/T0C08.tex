\subsection{Reducing Exposure to RF Radiation}
\label{T0C08}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=T0C08]
Which of the following actions can reduce exposure to RF radiation?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item \textbf{Relocate antennas}
    \item Relocate the transmitter
    \item Increase the duty cycle
    \item All these choices are correct
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

To reduce exposure to RF radiation, relocating antennas is an effective measure. This helps in minimizing the direct exposure to the radiation emitted by the antennas. Relocating the transmitter may not necessarily reduce exposure, as the antennas are the primary source of radiation. Increasing the duty cycle would actually increase the exposure, as it means the transmitter is active for a longer period. Therefore, the correct answer is to relocate the antennas.
