\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=T0C12]
How does RF radiation differ from ionizing radiation (radioactivity)?
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*)]
    \item \textbf{RF radiation does not have sufficient energy to cause chemical changes in cells and damage DNA}
    \item RF radiation can only be detected with an RF dosimeter
    \item RF radiation is limited in range to a few feet
    \item RF radiation is perfectly safe
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine RF radiation as a gentle breeze and ionizing radiation as a hurricane. The breeze (RF radiation) might make you feel a little cool, but it won’t knock you over or break anything. On the other hand, the hurricane (ionizing radiation) has enough power to cause serious damage, like breaking windows or uprooting trees. In the same way, RF radiation doesn’t have enough energy to mess with your cells or DNA, while ionizing radiation can cause chemical changes and damage.

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
RF (Radio Frequency) radiation is a type of non-ionizing electromagnetic radiation, typically in the frequency range of 3 kHz to 300 GHz. The energy of RF photons is given by \( E = h \nu \), where \( h \) is Planck's constant (\( 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \) J·s) and \( \nu \) is the frequency. For example, at 1 GHz, the energy of an RF photon is approximately \( 6.626 \times 10^{-25} \) Joules. This energy is much lower than the energy required to ionize atoms or molecules, which is typically on the order of \( 10^{-18} \) Joules.

Ionizing radiation, such as X-rays and gamma rays, has much higher energy and can remove tightly bound electrons from atoms, leading to ionization. This ionization can cause chemical changes in cells, including DNA damage, which can lead to mutations and cancer. RF radiation, due to its lower energy, does not have this capability and is generally considered non-harmful at typical exposure levels.
