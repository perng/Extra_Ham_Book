\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=T0C09]
How can you make sure your station stays in compliance with RF safety regulations?
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*)]
    \item By informing the FCC of any changes made in your station
    \item \textbf{By re-evaluating the station whenever an item in the transmitter or antenna system is changed}
    \item By making sure your antennas have low SWR
    \item All these choices are correct
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine your radio station is like a car. If you change the engine or the tires, you need to check if it’s still safe to drive, right? Similarly, if you change anything in your radio transmitter or antenna, you need to re-evaluate to make sure it’s still safe and follows the rules. This is like giving your car a safety check after any major changes.

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
RF (Radio Frequency) safety regulations are designed to ensure that the electromagnetic fields generated by radio transmitters do not pose a health risk to humans. When any component of the transmitter or antenna system is altered, the RF exposure levels can change. Therefore, it is crucial to re-evaluate the station to ensure compliance with the Maximum Permissible Exposure (MPE) limits set by regulatory bodies like the FCC.

The process involves calculating the new RF exposure levels based on the updated system parameters. This includes the transmitter power, antenna gain, and the distance from the antenna to the public or operators. The formula for calculating the power density \( S \) at a distance \( d \) from the antenna is given by:

\[ S = \frac{P \cdot G}{4 \pi d^2} \]

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( P \) is the transmitter power,
    \item \( G \) is the antenna gain,
    \item \( d \) is the distance from the antenna.
\end{itemize}

By ensuring that \( S \) remains below the MPE limits, the station stays in compliance with RF safety regulations.
