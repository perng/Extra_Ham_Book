\label{T1C04}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=T1C04]
What may happen if the FCC is unable to reach you by email?
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*,noitemsep]
    \item Fine and suspension of operator license
    \item \textbf{Revocation of the station license or suspension of the operator license}
    \item Revocation of access to the license record in the FCC system
    \item Nothing; there is no such requirement
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

The FCC requires licensees to maintain a valid email address on file. If the FCC cannot reach you by email, it may result in serious consequences, including the revocation of your station license or the suspension of your operator license. This ensures that the FCC can effectively communicate important regulatory information and updates.
