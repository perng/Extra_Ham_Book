\subsection{Transmitting with an Expired License}
\label{T1C11}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=T1C11]
If your license has expired and is still within the allowable grace period, may you continue to transmit on the amateur radio bands?
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*,noitemsep]
    \item Yes, for up to two years
    \item Yes, as soon as you apply for renewal
    \item Yes, for up to one year
    \item \textbf{No, you must wait until the license has been renewed}
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

This question is straightforward and does not require a detailed technical explanation. The key point is that even if your license is within the grace period, you are not allowed to transmit until it has been officially renewed. This ensures compliance with regulatory requirements and avoids potential penalties.
