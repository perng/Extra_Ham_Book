\label{T1C10}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=T1C10]
How soon after passing the examination for your first amateur radio license may you transmit on the amateur radio bands?
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*,noitemsep]
    \item Immediately on receiving your Certificate of Successful Completion of Examination (CSCE)
    \item As soon as your operator/station license grant appears on the ARRL website
    \item \textbf{As soon as your operator/station license grant appears in the FCC’s license database}
    \item As soon as you receive your license in the mail from the FCC
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsubsection*{Explanation}
After passing the amateur radio license examination, you are allowed to transmit on the amateur radio bands as soon as your operator/station license grant appears in the FCC’s license database. This is the official point at which your license is considered active, even if you have not yet received the physical license in the mail. The Certificate of Successful Completion of Examination (CSCE) does not grant immediate transmission privileges, and the ARRL website is not the official source for license activation.
