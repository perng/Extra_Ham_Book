Who may select a desired call sign under the vanity call sign rules?
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*,noitemsep]
    \item Only a licensed amateur with a General or Amateur Extra Class license
    \item Only a licensed amateur with an Amateur Extra Class license
    \item Only a licensed amateur who has been licensed continuously for more than 10 years
    \item \textbf{Any licensed amateur}
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

The vanity call sign rules allow any licensed amateur radio operator to select a desired call sign, regardless of their license class or how long they have been licensed. This makes option D the correct answer.
