\label{T1C05}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=T1C05]
Which of the following is a valid Technician class call sign format?
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*)]
    \item \textbf{KF1XXX}
    \item KA1X
    \item W1XX
    \item All these choices are correct
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsubsection{Explanation}
In the United States, amateur radio call signs are issued by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and follow a specific structure. For Technician class operators, the call sign typically consists of a prefix, a numeral, and a suffix. The prefix is usually one or two letters, the numeral is a single digit (1-9), and the suffix is one to three letters. 

The correct format for a Technician class call sign is \textbf{KF1XXX}. Here's why:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{KF}: This is the prefix. K is a common prefix for U.S. call signs, and F is part of the sequence that follows.
    \item \textbf{1}: This is the numeral, representing the region. In this case, 1 corresponds to the northeastern United States.
    \item \textbf{XXX}: This is the suffix, which can be one to three letters. It uniquely identifies the operator within the region.
\end{itemize}

The other options do not meet these criteria:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{KA1X}: This is missing a letter in the suffix.
    \item \textbf{W1XX}: While W is a valid prefix, this format is not standard for Technician class operators.
    \item \textbf{All these choices are correct}: This is incorrect because only \textbf{KF1XXX} follows the valid format.
\end{itemize}

Understanding the structure of call signs is essential for identifying operators and ensuring compliance with FCC regulations. The format ensures that each call sign is unique and provides information about the operator's license class and location.
