What types of international communications are an FCC-licensed amateur radio station permitted to make?
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*,noitemsep]
    \item \textbf{Communications incidental to the purposes of the Amateur Radio Service and remarks of a personal character}
    \item Communications incidental to conducting business or remarks of a personal nature
    \item Only communications incidental to contest exchanges; all other communications are prohibited
    \item Any communications that would be permitted by an international broadcast station
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

FCC-licensed amateur radio stations are allowed to engage in communications that are incidental to the purposes of the Amateur Radio Service, which includes technical experimentation, self-training, and the exchange of messages. Additionally, personal remarks are permitted as long as they do not involve business or commercial activities. This ensures that amateur radio remains a non-commercial service focused on personal and technical communication.
