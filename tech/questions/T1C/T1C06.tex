\label{T1C06}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=T1C06]
From which of the following locations may an FCC-licensed amateur station transmit?
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*,noitemsep]
    \item From within any country that belongs to the International Telecommunication Union
    \item From within any country that is a member of the United Nations
    \item From anywhere within International Telecommunication Union (ITU) Regions 2 and 3
    \item \textbf{From any vessel or craft located in international waters and documented or registered in the United States}
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsubsection*{Explanation}
An FCC-licensed amateur station is authorized to transmit from any vessel or craft located in international waters, provided that the vessel or craft is documented or registered in the United States. This ensures that the station operates under the jurisdiction of the FCC, even when not within the physical borders of the United States. The other options do not align with the specific regulations governing FCC-licensed amateur stations.
