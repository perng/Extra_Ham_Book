What is a characteristic of VHF signals received via auroral backscatter?
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*)]
    \item They are often received from 10,000 miles or more
    \item \textbf{They are distorted and signal strength varies considerably}
    \item They occur only during winter nighttime hours
    \item They are generally strongest when your antenna is aimed west
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you're trying to talk to your friend through a funhouse mirror. The mirror bends and twists your voice, making it sound weird and sometimes hard to hear. That's kind of what happens with VHF signals when they bounce off the aurora! The aurora acts like a funhouse mirror for radio waves, making the signals come through all distorted and wobbly. So, if you're listening to a VHF signal that's been bounced off the aurora, expect it to sound a bit strange and the strength to go up and down like a rollercoaster!

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
Auroral backscatter occurs when VHF (Very High Frequency) signals are reflected by the ionized regions of the atmosphere associated with auroras. These ionized regions are highly dynamic and irregular, leading to significant distortion and variability in the received signals. The signal strength can fluctuate rapidly due to the changing density and movement of the ionized particles. 

Mathematically, the received signal \( S(t) \) can be modeled as:
\[ S(t) = A(t) \cdot \cos(2\pi f_c t + \phi(t)) \]
where \( A(t) \) represents the time-varying amplitude due to the auroral backscatter, \( f_c \) is the carrier frequency, and \( \phi(t) \) is the phase distortion caused by the irregular ionized regions.

The distortion arises because the ionized regions act as a non-uniform reflector, causing multipath propagation and phase shifts. This results in a signal that is both distorted and variable in strength, which is characteristic of VHF signals received via auroral backscatter.
