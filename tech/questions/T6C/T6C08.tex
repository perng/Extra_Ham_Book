\subsection{Component Identification in Figure T-2}
\label{T6C08}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=T6C08]
What is component 9 in figure T-2?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item Variable capacitor
    \item Variable inductor
    \item \textbf{Variable resistor}
    \item Variable transformer
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

This question is straightforward and requires identifying a specific component in a given figure. The correct answer is a variable resistor, which is commonly used in circuits to adjust resistance levels.
