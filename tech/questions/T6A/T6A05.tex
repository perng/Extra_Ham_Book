\subsubsection*{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you have two metal plates and you put a piece of plastic between them. Now, if you connect these plates to a battery, the plates will store some electric charge. This setup is like a tiny battery that can store and release energy quickly. This is essentially what a capacitor doesâ€”it stores electrical energy using two conductive surfaces separated by an insulator.

\subsubsection*{Advanced Explanation}
A capacitor is an electrical component that stores energy in an electric field. It consists of two conductive plates separated by a dielectric (insulator). When a voltage is applied across the plates, an electric field develops across the dielectric, causing positive charge to accumulate on one plate and negative charge on the other. The capacitance \( C \) of a capacitor is given by the formula:
\[
C = \frac{\epsilon A}{d}
\]
where \( \epsilon \) is the permittivity of the dielectric, \( A \) is the area of the plates, and \( d \) is the distance between the plates. Capacitors are widely used in electronic circuits for filtering, energy storage, and signal processing.
