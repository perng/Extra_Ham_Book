\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=T6A02]
What type of component is often used as an adjustable volume control?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item Fixed resistor
    \item Power resistor
    \item \textbf{Potentiometer}
    \item Transformer
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

A potentiometer is commonly used as an adjustable volume control because it allows for the variation of resistance, which in turn adjusts the signal level. This makes it ideal for controlling volume in audio devices.
