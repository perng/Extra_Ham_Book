What is antenna gain?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item The additional power that is added to the transmitter power
    \item The additional power that is required in the antenna when transmitting on a higher frequency
    \item \textbf{The increase in signal strength in a specified direction compared to a reference antenna}
    \item The increase in impedance on receive or transmit compared to a reference antenna
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

Antenna gain refers to the increase in signal strength in a specific direction compared to a reference antenna, typically an isotropic radiator or a dipole. This concept is crucial in understanding how antennas focus energy in particular directions to improve communication efficiency.
