\label{T9A12}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=T9A12]
What is an advantage of a 5/8 wavelength whip antenna for VHF or UHF mobile service?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item \textbf{It has more gain than a 1/4-wavelength antenna}
    \item It radiates at a very high angle
    \item It eliminates distortion caused by reflected signals
    \item It has 10 times the power gain of a 1/4 wavelength whip
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

The 5/8 wavelength whip antenna offers higher gain compared to a 1/4-wavelength antenna, making it more efficient for VHF or UHF mobile service. This increased gain helps in improving signal strength and range.
