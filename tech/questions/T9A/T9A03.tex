\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*]
    \item A ground-wave antenna
    \item \textbf{A horizontally polarized antenna}
    \item A travelling-wave antenna
    \item A vertically polarized antenna
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you’re holding a jump rope and you’re swinging it side to side, parallel to the ground. The rope is moving horizontally, right? Now, think of a simple dipole antenna as that jump rope. When it’s oriented parallel to the Earth’s surface, it’s like the rope swinging side to side. This means the antenna is horizontally polarized. So, the correct answer is the one that says it’s a horizontally polarized antenna. Easy peasy!

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
A dipole antenna consists of two conductive elements that are aligned in a straight line. When this dipole is oriented parallel to the Earth's surface, the electric field (E-field) produced by the antenna is also parallel to the ground. This orientation results in horizontal polarization. 

Polarization refers to the orientation of the electric field vector of the radio wave. In the case of a horizontally polarized antenna, the electric field oscillates in a plane parallel to the Earth's surface. This is in contrast to vertical polarization, where the electric field oscillates perpendicular to the ground.

The polarization of an antenna is crucial because it affects how the radio waves propagate and interact with the environment. For instance, horizontally polarized antennas are often used in applications where the signal needs to reflect off the ground or other surfaces, such as in certain types of broadcasting or communication systems.

Mathematically, the polarization can be described by the direction of the electric field vector \(\mathbf{E}\). For a horizontally polarized antenna, \(\mathbf{E}\) lies in the horizontal plane, and its components in the vertical direction are zero. This can be represented as:
\[
\mathbf{E} = E_x \hat{x} + E_y \hat{y} + 0 \hat{z}
\]
where \(E_x\) and \(E_y\) are the horizontal components of the electric field, and \(\hat{x}\), \(\hat{y}\), and \(\hat{z}\) are the unit vectors in the respective directions.

Understanding the polarization of antennas is essential for optimizing signal transmission and reception in various communication systems.
