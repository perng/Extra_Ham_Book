What is Voice Over Internet Protocol (VoIP)?  
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]  
    \item A set of rules specifying how to identify your station when linked over the internet to another station  
    \item A technique employed to “spot” DX stations via the internet  
    \item A technique for measuring the modulation quality of a transmitter using remote sites monitored via the internet  
    \item \textbf{A method of delivering voice communications over the internet using digital techniques}  
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}  
Imagine you’re sending a letter, but instead of paper, you’re using the internet to send your voice. VoIP is like a magical postal service that turns your words into tiny digital packages, sends them over the internet, and then reassembles them into your voice at the other end. It’s how you can talk to your friends on apps like Skype or Zoom without needing a traditional phone line. Cool, right?

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}  
Voice Over Internet Protocol (VoIP) is a technology that enables voice communication to be transmitted over the internet using digital techniques. Unlike traditional telephony, which relies on analog signals over dedicated circuits, VoIP converts voice signals into digital data packets. These packets are then transmitted over an IP network (such as the internet) and reassembled at the receiving end.  

The process involves several key steps:  
1. \textbf{Analog-to-Digital Conversion}: The analog voice signal is sampled and converted into a digital format using a codec (coder-decoder).  
2. \textbf{Packetization}: The digital data is divided into small packets, each containing a portion of the voice data along with header information for routing.  
3. \textbf{Transmission}: The packets are transmitted over the internet using protocols such as RTP (Real-Time Transport Protocol) and SIP (Session Initiation Protocol).  
4. \textbf{Reassembly and Playback}: At the receiving end, the packets are reassembled in the correct order, converted back into an analog signal, and played as voice.  

VoIP offers advantages such as cost efficiency, scalability, and integration with other digital services. It is widely used in applications like video conferencing, online gaming, and unified communications systems.
