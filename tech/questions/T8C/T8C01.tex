\subsection{Locating Noise Interference Sources}
\label{T8C01}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=T8C01]
Which of the following methods is used to locate sources of noise interference or jamming?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item Echolocation
    \item Doppler radar
    \item \textbf{Radio direction finding}
    \item Phase locking
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsubsection*{Explanation}
Radio direction finding (RDF) is a technique used to determine the direction from which a radio signal is being transmitted. This method is particularly useful for locating sources of noise interference or jamming. By using specialized equipment, such as directional antennas, the operator can pinpoint the origin of the interfering signal. This is a fundamental technique in radio communication and is widely used in both amateur and professional settings.
