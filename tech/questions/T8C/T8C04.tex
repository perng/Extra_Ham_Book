Which of the following is good procedure when contacting another station in a contest?
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*)]
    \item Sign only the last two letters of your call if there are many other stations calling
    \item Contact the station twice to be sure that you are in his log
    \item \textbf{Send only the minimum information needed for proper identification and the contest exchange}
    \item All these choices are correct
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you're at a big party, and you want to talk to someone quickly without causing a scene. You wouldn't shout your entire life story at them, right? Instead, you'd say just enough to get your point across and move on. In a radio contest, it's the same idea! You want to be quick and efficient, so you only share the necessary info—like your call sign and the contest details—so everyone can keep the party (or contest) moving smoothly.

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
In radio contests, efficiency and clarity are paramount. The goal is to maximize the number of successful contacts within a limited time frame. When contacting another station, it is essential to adhere to the contest rules, which typically require proper identification and the exchange of specific contest-related information. 

Option C is correct because it emphasizes the importance of brevity and clarity. Sending only the minimum information needed ensures that the exchange is quick and reduces the likelihood of errors or misunderstandings. This practice is particularly crucial in high-traffic contests where many stations are attempting to make contacts simultaneously.

Options A and B are incorrect for the following reasons:
- \textbf{Option A}: Signing only the last two letters of your call sign violates the FCC regulations, which require the full call sign for proper identification.
- \textbf{Option B}: Contacting the station twice is unnecessary and inefficient. It wastes valuable time and can lead to confusion or duplication in the log.

Option D is incorrect because not all the provided choices are good procedures. Only Option C adheres to the best practices for contest operation.
