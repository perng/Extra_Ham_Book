\subsection{D-STAR Transceiver Programming}\label{T4B11}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=T4B11]
Which of the following must be programmed into a D-STAR digital transceiver before transmitting?
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
    \item \textbf{Your call sign}
    \item Your output power
    \item The codec type being used
    \item All these choices are correct
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you're sending a letter to a friend. Before you send it, you need to write your name on it so they know who it's from. Similarly, when you use a D-STAR digital transceiver, you need to tell it your call sign—your radio name—so others know who's talking. The other stuff, like how loud you're talking or the type of language you're using, is already set up for you. So, just like signing your letter, your call sign is the most important thing to program before you start transmitting.

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
In D-STAR (Digital Smart Technologies for Amateur Radio), the call sign is a critical identifier that must be programmed into the transceiver before transmission. This is because D-STAR uses digital protocols that require the call sign for proper routing and identification of the signal. The call sign is embedded in the digital data stream and is used by repeaters and other stations to identify the source of the transmission.

The output power and codec type are typically pre-configured or automatically managed by the transceiver. Output power is usually set based on the user's preference or regulatory limits, while the codec type (e.g., AMBE) is standardized in D-STAR systems and does not need to be manually programmed for each transmission.

Therefore, the only mandatory information that must be programmed before transmitting is the user's call sign. This ensures compliance with regulatory requirements and proper functioning of the D-STAR network.
