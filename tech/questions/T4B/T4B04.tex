What is a way to enable quick access to a favorite frequency or channel on your transceiver?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item Enable the frequency offset
    \item \textbf{Store it in a memory channel}
    \item Enable the VOX
    \item Use the scan mode to select the desired frequency
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

To quickly access a favorite frequency or channel on your transceiver, the most efficient method is to store it in a memory channel. This allows you to recall the frequency instantly without manually tuning it each time. The other options, such as enabling the frequency offset, VOX, or using scan mode, do not provide the same level of convenience for accessing a specific frequency.
