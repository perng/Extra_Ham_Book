\subsection{Adjusting Squelch for Weak FM Signals}
\label{T4B03}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=T4B03]
How is squelch adjusted so that a weak FM signal can be heard?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item \textbf{Set the squelch threshold so that receiver output audio is on all the time}
    \item Turn up the audio level until it overcomes the squelch threshold
    \item Turn on the anti-squelch function
    \item Enable squelch enhancement
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

To hear a weak FM signal, the squelch threshold should be set so that the receiver's output audio is always on. This ensures that even weak signals are not muted by the squelch circuit.
