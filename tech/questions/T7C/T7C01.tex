What is the primary purpose of a dummy load?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item \textbf{To prevent transmitting signals over the air when making tests}
    \item To prevent over-modulation of a transmitter
    \item To improve the efficiency of an antenna
    \item To improve the signal-to-noise ratio of a receiver
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

A dummy load is used to absorb the RF energy from a transmitter during testing, ensuring that no signals are broadcasted over the air. This is crucial for safe and compliant testing of radio equipment.
