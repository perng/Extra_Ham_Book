\subsection{Power Loss in Feed Lines}
\label{T7C07}

What happens to power lost in a feed line?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item It increases the SWR
    \item It is radiated as harmonics
    \item \textbf{It is converted into heat}
    \item It distorts the signal
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

When power is lost in a feed line, it is primarily due to resistance in the conductors and dielectric losses. This lost energy is converted into heat, which is why the correct answer is \textbf{C}. This is a fundamental concept in understanding the efficiency of transmission lines in radio systems.
