\subsection{UV Resistance in Coaxial Cable Jackets}
\label{T7C10}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=T7C10]
Why should the outer jacket of coaxial cable be resistant to ultraviolet light?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item Ultraviolet resistant jackets prevent harmonic radiation
    \item Ultraviolet light can increase losses in the cableâ€™s jacket
    \item Ultraviolet and RF signals can mix, causing interference
    \item \textbf{Ultraviolet light can damage the jacket and allow water to enter the cable}
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

The outer jacket of coaxial cable is exposed to environmental factors, including sunlight. Ultraviolet (UV) light can degrade materials over time, leading to cracks or breaks in the jacket. If the jacket is compromised, moisture can enter the cable, causing signal loss or even permanent damage. Therefore, UV resistance is crucial to ensure the longevity and reliability of the cable.
