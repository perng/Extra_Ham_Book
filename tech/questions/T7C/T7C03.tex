\subsection{Dummy Load Composition}
\label{T7C03}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=T7C03]
What does a dummy load consist of?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item A high-gain amplifier and a TR switch
    \item \textbf{A non-inductive resistor mounted on a heat sink}
    \item A low-voltage power supply and a DC relay
    \item A 50-ohm reactance used to terminate a transmission line
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

A dummy load is essentially a device that simulates an antenna without radiating any signal. It is used to test transmitters safely. The correct answer is \textbf{B}, which describes a non-inductive resistor mounted on a heat sink. This setup ensures that the resistor can dissipate the power generated by the transmitter without causing interference.
