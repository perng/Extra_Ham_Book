\subsection{Determining SWR with Instruments}
\label{T7C08}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=T7C08]
Which instrument can be used to determine SWR?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item Voltmeter
    \item Ohmmeter
    \item Iambic pentameter
    \item \textbf{Directional wattmeter}
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsubsection*{Explanation}
The Standing Wave Ratio (SWR) is a measure of how well the impedance of the antenna matches the impedance of the transmission line. A directional wattmeter is specifically designed to measure the forward and reflected power in a transmission line, which can then be used to calculate the SWR. Other instruments like voltmeters and ohmmeters do not provide the necessary measurements for determining SWR. The Iambic pentameter is a poetic meter and unrelated to radio technology.
