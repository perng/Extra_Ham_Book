\subsubsection*{Explanation}
Amateur radio stations are generally not permitted to transmit information in support of broadcasting, program production, or news gathering. However, there is an exception when such communications are directly related to the immediate safety of human life or protection of property. This exception ensures that amateur radio can be used as a vital communication tool in emergencies when no other means of communication are available.
