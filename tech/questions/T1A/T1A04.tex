\subsubsection*{Explanation}
In the context of radio operation, an operator/primary station license is a legal authorization granted by the regulatory authority (such as the FCC in the United States) that allows an individual to operate a radio station. According to the regulations, any one person is allowed to hold only one such license. This ensures that the allocation of licenses is fair and that no single individual can monopolize the available resources or frequencies. Therefore, the correct answer is \textbf{A: One}.
