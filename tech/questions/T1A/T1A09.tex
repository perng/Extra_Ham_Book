Who selects a Frequency Coordinator?
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*)]
    \item The FCC Office of Spectrum Management and Coordination Policy
    \item The local chapter of the Office of National Council of Independent Frequency Coordinators
    \item \textbf{Amateur operators in a local or regional area whose stations are eligible to be repeater or auxiliary stations}
    \item FCC Regional Field Office
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you and your friends are organizing a big game of tag in your neighborhood. You need someone to decide where everyone can play without bumping into each other. In the world of radio, this person is called the Frequency Coordinator. It’s not the government or some big office that picks this person—it’s actually the radio enthusiasts in your area who decide who gets to be the coordinator. They’re the ones who know the best spots to play (or in this case, the best frequencies to use)!

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
In amateur radio operations, the selection of a Frequency Coordinator is a decentralized process. The responsibility falls on the amateur operators within a local or regional area who operate repeater or auxiliary stations. These operators are best suited to understand the specific frequency usage and interference issues in their area. The Frequency Coordinator’s role is to manage and allocate frequencies to ensure efficient and interference-free communication among amateur radio stations. This selection process is not governed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) or any national council but is instead a community-driven decision. The coordinator’s primary task is to optimize the use of available frequencies, which involves understanding the technical aspects of radio wave propagation, interference mitigation, and the regulatory framework set by the FCC.
