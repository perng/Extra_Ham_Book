\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you’re building a super cool walkie-talkie that can talk to people across the world. The main goal of amateur radio isn’t just to chat with your friends or help out charities (though that’s awesome too!). It’s really about becoming a radio wizard—learning how to make your radio better, understanding how signals travel, and becoming a pro at communicating. So, the right answer is all about leveling up your radio skills!

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
The Amateur Radio Service, as defined by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and international regulations, has several key purposes. One of the primary objectives is to advance skills in the technical and communication phases of the radio art. This involves fostering innovation, experimentation, and education in radio technology. 

The other options, while beneficial, are not the core purposes of the Amateur Radio Service. Providing personal radio communications for as many citizens as possible is more aligned with commercial or public safety services. Similarly, providing communications for international non-profit organizations, while a noble endeavor, is not the fundamental basis of amateur radio. 

Therefore, the correct answer is \textbf{C}, as it directly aligns with the stated purpose of advancing technical and communication skills in the field of amateur radio.
