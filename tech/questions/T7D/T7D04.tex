\subsection{Instrument for Measuring Electric Current}
\label{T7D04}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=T7D04]
Which instrument is used to measure electric current?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item An ohmmeter
    \item An electrometer
    \item A voltmeter
    \item \textbf{An ammeter}
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

An ammeter is the instrument specifically designed to measure electric current. It is connected in series with the circuit to measure the flow of current. The other instruments listed have different purposes: an ohmmeter measures resistance, an electrometer measures electric charge, and a voltmeter measures voltage.
