\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=T7D07]
Which of the following measurements are made using a multimeter?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item Signal strength and noise
    \item Impedance and reactance
    \item \textbf{Voltage and resistance}
    \item All these choices are correct
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

A multimeter is a versatile tool commonly used to measure electrical properties. The correct answer is \textbf{C}, as multimeters are primarily designed to measure voltage and resistance. While some advanced multimeters can measure other properties, the basic function includes these two measurements.
