\subsection{Measuring Electric Potential}
\label{T7D01}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=T7D01]
Which instrument would you use to measure electric potential?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item An ammeter
    \item \textbf{A voltmeter}
    \item A wavemeter
    \item An ohmmeter
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

To measure electric potential, you would use a voltmeter. Electric potential is measured in volts, and a voltmeter is specifically designed to measure this quantity. An ammeter measures current, a wavemeter measures wavelength, and an ohmmeter measures resistance. Therefore, the correct answer is \textbf{B}.
