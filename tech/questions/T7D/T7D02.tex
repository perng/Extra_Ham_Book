\subsection{Voltmeter Connection for Voltage Measurement}
\label{T7D02}

How is a voltmeter connected to a component to measure applied voltage?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item In series
    \item \textbf{In parallel}
    \item In quadrature
    \item In phase
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

To measure the voltage across a component, a voltmeter must be connected in parallel with that component. This ensures that the voltmeter measures the potential difference across the component without altering the circuit's current flow. Connecting it in series would disrupt the circuit, while quadrature and phase are irrelevant in this context.
