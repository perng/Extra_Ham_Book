\label{T4A02}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=T4A02]
Which of the following should be considered when selecting an accessory SWR meter?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item \textbf{The frequency and power level at which the measurements will be made}
    \item The distance that the meter will be located from the antenna
    \item The types of modulation being used at the station
    \item All these choices are correct
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

When selecting an SWR meter, it is crucial to ensure that it is compatible with the frequency and power levels at which you intend to make measurements. This ensures accurate readings and prevents damage to the meter. The other options, such as the distance from the antenna or the types of modulation, are not relevant factors in selecting an SWR meter.
