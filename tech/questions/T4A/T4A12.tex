What is an electronic keyer?  
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*)]
    \item A device for switching antennas from transmit to receive
    \item A device for voice activated switching from receive to transmit
    \item \textbf{A device that assists in manual sending of Morse code}
    \item An interlock to prevent unauthorized use of a radio
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you're trying to send a secret message using Morse code, but your fingers are tired from tapping out all those dots and dashes. An electronic keyer is like a helpful robot that takes over the tapping for you! It makes sure your Morse code is sent smoothly and accurately, so you don't have to worry about messing up. Think of it as your Morse code assistant, making your life a whole lot easier.

\subsubsection*{Advanced Explanation}
An electronic keyer is a device designed to aid in the manual transmission of Morse code. It typically consists of a pair of paddles that the operator uses to input dots (short signals) and dashes (long signals). The keyer then generates the corresponding Morse code signals electronically, ensuring consistent timing and accuracy. This is particularly useful in amateur radio operations, where precise Morse code transmission is essential for clear communication. The keyer can also be programmed to store and repeat sequences of Morse code, further enhancing its utility.
