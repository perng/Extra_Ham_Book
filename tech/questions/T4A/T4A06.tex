\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you're playing a game of telephone with your friend, but instead of using your voices, you're using a computer and a radio. The computer needs to send and receive messages through the radio. To do this, it uses three main signals: the sound it hears (receive audio), the sound it sends (transmit audio), and a button to tell the radio when to start and stop talking (transmitter keying). It's like having a walkie-talkie that listens, talks, and knows when to push the button to send your message.

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
In digital mode operation, the computer-radio interface primarily handles three types of signals:

1. \textbf{Receive Audio}: This signal carries the audio data received by the radio. The computer processes this audio to decode the digital information.

2. \textbf{Transmit Audio}: This signal carries the audio data generated by the computer that needs to be transmitted by the radio. The computer encodes the digital information into audio signals that the radio can transmit.

3. \textbf{Transmitter Keying}: This signal controls when the radio should start and stop transmitting. It acts as a switch, ensuring that the radio only transmits when there is data to send.

These signals are essential for effective communication in digital modes, where precise control over the transmission and reception of data is required. The interface ensures that the computer and radio can work together seamlessly to encode, transmit, receive, and decode digital information.
