\subsection{Resistance Calculation from Voltage and Current}
\label{T5D06}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=T5D06]
What is the resistance of a circuit that draws 4 amperes from a 12-volt source?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item \textbf{3 ohms}
    \item 16 ohms
    \item 48 ohms
    \item 8 ohms
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsubsection*{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you have a water hose connected to a water source. The voltage is like the water pressure, and the current is like the amount of water flowing through the hose. Resistance is how much the hose is squeezing the water flow. If you have a high pressure (12 volts) and a lot of water flowing (4 amperes), the hose isn't squeezing much, so the resistance is low. In this case, it's 3 ohms.

\subsubsection*{Advanced Explanation}
The relationship between voltage (V), current (I), and resistance (R) is given by Ohm's Law:
\[
V = I \times R
\]
To find the resistance, rearrange the formula:
\[
R = \frac{V}{I}
\]
Substitute the given values:
\[
R = \frac{12\ \text{volts}}{4\ \text{amperes}} = 3\ \text{ohms}
\]
Thus, the resistance of the circuit is 3 ohms.
