\subsection{Voltage Across a Resistor}
\label{T5D10}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=T5D10]
What is the voltage across a 2-ohm resistor if a current of 0.5 amperes flows through it?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item \textbf{1 volt}
    \item 0.25 volts
    \item 2.5 volts
    \item 1.5 volts
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsubsection*{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine the resistor as a narrow pipe and the current as water flowing through it. The voltage is like the pressure pushing the water through the pipe. If the pipe is narrow (high resistance) and the water flow is slow (low current), the pressure (voltage) will be low. Conversely, if the pipe is wide (low resistance) and the water flow is fast (high current), the pressure (voltage) will be high. In this case, the pipe is moderately narrow (2 ohms) and the water flow is moderate (0.5 amperes), so the pressure (voltage) is 1 volt.

\subsubsection*{Advanced Explanation}
The voltage across a resistor can be calculated using Ohm's Law, which states that \( V = I \times R \), where \( V \) is the voltage, \( I \) is the current, and \( R \) is the resistance. In this problem, the current \( I \) is 0.5 amperes and the resistance \( R \) is 2 ohms. Plugging these values into Ohm's Law gives:

\[
V = 0.5 \, \text{A} \times 2 \, \Omega = 1 \, \text{V}
\]

Thus, the voltage across the resistor is 1 volt.
