\subsection{Resistance Calculation}
\label{T5D05}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=T5D05]
What is the resistance of a circuit for which the applied voltage is 12 volts and the current flow is 1.5 amperes?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item 18 ohms
    \item 0.125 ohms
    \item \textbf{8 ohms}
    \item 13.5 ohms
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsubsection*{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you have a water hose. The voltage is like the water pressure, and the current is like the flow of water. The resistance is how much the hose resists the flow of water. If you have a certain pressure (voltage) and a certain flow (current), you can figure out how much the hose is resisting the flow. In this case, with 12 volts and 1.5 amperes, the resistance is 8 ohms.

\subsubsection*{Advanced Explanation}
According to Ohm's Law, the resistance \( R \) in a circuit can be calculated using the formula:
\[
R = \frac{V}{I}
\]
where \( V \) is the voltage and \( I \) is the current. Given \( V = 12 \) volts and \( I = 1.5 \) amperes, we can substitute these values into the formula:
\[
R = \frac{12}{1.5} = 8 \text{ ohms}
\]
Thus, the resistance of the circuit is 8 ohms.
