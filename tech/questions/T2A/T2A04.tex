\subsection{Appropriate Way to Call Another Station on a Repeater}\label{T2A04}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=T2A04]
What is an appropriate way to call another station on a repeater if you know the other station's call sign?
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*]
    \item Say break, break, then say the station's call sign
    \item \textbf{Say the station's call sign, then identify with your call sign}
    \item Say CQ three times, then the other station's call sign
    \item Wait for the station to call CQ, then answer
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you're at a big party, and you want to talk to your friend across the room. You wouldn't just yell Hey! and hope they notice you. Instead, you'd call their name first, so they know you're talking to them, and then say who you are so they can recognize you. That's exactly what you do on a repeater! You say the other station's call sign first to get their attention, and then you say your own call sign so they know who's calling. Easy peasy!

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
When operating on a repeater, proper protocol ensures clear and efficient communication. The correct procedure is to first announce the call sign of the station you wish to contact, followed by your own call sign. This method is standardized to avoid confusion and ensure that the intended recipient knows they are being addressed. 

For example, if your call sign is W1ABC and you want to contact W2XYZ, you would say: 
\[
\text{W2XYZ, this is W1ABC.}
\]
This format is universally recognized in amateur radio communications and helps maintain order on the airwaves. 

Additionally, using CQ or break, break is not appropriate in this context. CQ is used for general calls when you are seeking any station to respond, and break, break is typically used in emergency situations or to interrupt ongoing communications. Therefore, the correct answer is to say the station's call sign first, followed by your own.
