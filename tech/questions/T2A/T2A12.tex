What should you do before calling CQ?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item Listen first to be sure that no one else is using the frequency
    \item Ask if the frequency is in use
    \item Make sure you are authorized to use that frequency
    \item \textbf{All these choices are correct}
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

Before calling CQ, it is essential to ensure that the frequency is clear, that you are authorized to use it, and that no one else is already using it. This practice helps maintain order and prevents interference with ongoing communications.
