How should you respond to a station calling CQ?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item Transmit CQ followed by the other station’s call sign
    \item Transmit your call sign followed by the other station’s call sign
    \item \textbf{Transmit the other station’s call sign followed by your call sign}
    \item Transmit a signal report followed by your call sign
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

When a station calls CQ, it is essentially asking if anyone is listening and wants to communicate. The proper way to respond is to first acknowledge the station by transmitting their call sign, followed by your own call sign. This ensures clarity and avoids confusion in the communication.
