What is the meaning of the procedural signal “CQ”?  
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*)]
    \item Call on the quarter hour
    \item Test transmission, no reply expected
    \item Only the called station should transmit
    \item \textbf{Calling any station}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you’re at a big party, and you want to talk to someone, but you don’t know who’s available. So, you shout, “Hey, anyone want to chat?” That’s exactly what “CQ” means in the radio world! It’s like saying, “Hey, is anyone out there who wants to talk to me?” It’s a way to start a conversation with any station that’s listening, not just one specific person. So, if you hear “CQ,” it’s like someone’s waving their hand in the air, looking for a buddy to chat with!

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
In radio communication, “CQ” is a procedural signal used to indicate a general call to any station. It is derived from the French word “sécurité,” which means “safety,” but in this context, it has evolved to mean “calling any station.” When an operator transmits “CQ,” they are broadcasting a message to all stations within range, inviting any available station to respond. This is particularly useful in amateur radio, where operators may not know who is listening or available to communicate.

The use of “CQ” is standardized in radio communication protocols to ensure clarity and avoid confusion. It is not a test transmission (which would typically use a different signal), nor is it directed at a specific station. Instead, it is a general call, open to any station that wishes to respond. This makes it a fundamental part of initiating communication in amateur radio, especially when operators are seeking new contacts or participating in contests.
