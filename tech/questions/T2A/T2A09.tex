\label{T2A09}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title=T2A09]
Which of the following indicates that a station is listening on a repeater and looking for a contact?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item “CQ CQ” followed by the repeater’s call sign
    \item \textbf{The station’s call sign followed by the word “monitoring”}
    \item The repeater call sign followed by the station’s call sign
    \item “QSY” followed by your call sign
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

When a station is listening on a repeater and looking for a contact, they typically announce their call sign followed by the word monitoring. This indicates that they are actively listening and available for communication. The other options either refer to calling for a general contact (CQ) or changing frequency (QSY), which are not relevant to this specific scenario.
