\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you're trying to throw a ball through a rainstorm. The rain makes it harder for the ball to go far, right? Similarly, when microwaves (which are like invisible balls of energy) travel through rain, snow, or any kind of precipitation, they get slowed down or scattered. This makes it harder for them to reach as far as they would on a clear day. So, precipitation is like the rainstorm for microwaves, reducing their range.

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
Microwave frequencies are typically in the range of 1 GHz to 300 GHz. When microwaves propagate through the atmosphere, they can be attenuated by various factors, including precipitation. Precipitation, such as rain, snow, or fog, consists of water droplets or ice particles that can absorb and scatter microwave signals. The attenuation caused by precipitation is primarily due to the absorption of microwave energy by the water molecules and the scattering of the waves by the particles.

The attenuation \( A \) in dB/km due to rain can be approximated by the following empirical formula:

\[
A = aR^b
\]

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( R \) is the rainfall rate in mm/h,
    \item \( a \) and \( b \) are coefficients that depend on the frequency and polarization of the microwave signal.
\end{itemize}

For example, at a frequency of 10 GHz, typical values might be \( a = 0.03 \) and \( b = 1.2 \). If the rainfall rate \( R \) is 10 mm/h, the attenuation \( A \) would be:

\[
A = 0.03 \times 10^{1.2} \approx 0.03 \times 15.85 \approx 0.475 \text{ dB/km}
\]

This means that for every kilometer the microwave signal travels through this rain, it loses approximately 0.475 dB of power. Over long distances, this attenuation can significantly reduce the effective range of the microwave communication link.

Other weather conditions like high winds, low barometric pressure, or colder temperatures generally have a much smaller impact on microwave propagation compared to precipitation. Therefore, precipitation is the most significant weather condition that decreases the range at microwave frequencies.
