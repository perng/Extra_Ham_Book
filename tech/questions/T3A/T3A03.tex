\subsubsection{Intuitive Explanation}
Imagine you're trying to throw a frisbee to your friend across a big field. If you throw it flat and horizontally, it will go farther and stay in the air longer. Now, think of radio waves like frisbees. For long-distance communication on VHF and UHF bands, we use horizontal polarization because it helps the signal travel farther, just like a flat frisbee. So, horizontal is the way to go if you want your radio waves to fly far!

\subsubsection{Advanced Explanation}
In radio communication, polarization refers to the orientation of the electric field of the radio wave. For long-distance communication on VHF (Very High Frequency) and UHF (Ultra High Frequency) bands, horizontal polarization is typically used. This is because horizontally polarized waves tend to experience less ground wave attenuation and are less affected by reflections from the ground, which can be significant at these frequencies.

Mathematically, the polarization of an electromagnetic wave is described by the direction of the electric field vector $\mathbf{E}$. For horizontal polarization, $\mathbf{E}$ is parallel to the Earth's surface. The propagation characteristics of horizontally polarized waves are advantageous for long-distance communication, especially in line-of-sight scenarios.

Additionally, horizontal polarization can reduce interference from vertically polarized signals, which are more common in mobile and portable communication systems. This makes horizontal polarization a preferred choice for fixed, long-distance communication on VHF and UHF bands.
