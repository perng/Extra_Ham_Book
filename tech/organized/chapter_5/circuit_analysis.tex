\subsection*{Introduction}
Ohm's Law is one of the fundamental principles in electrical engineering and circuit analysis. It describes the relationship between voltage (\(E\)), current (\(I\)), and resistance (\(R\)) in an electrical circuit. Ohm's Law is expressed mathematically as:

\begin{equation}
    E = I \times R
    \label{eq:ohms_law}
\end{equation}

This equation states that the voltage across a conductor is directly proportional to the current flowing through it, with the constant of proportionality being the resistance. Ohm's Law is crucial for analyzing and designing electrical circuits, as it allows us to calculate unknown quantities when the other two are known.

\subsection*{Calculating Current, Voltage, and Resistance}
Using Ohm's Law, we can derive formulas to calculate current, voltage, and resistance:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Current (\(I\))}: The current flowing through a circuit can be calculated using the formula:
    \begin{equation}
        I = \frac{E}{R}
        \label{eq:current}
    \end{equation}
    
    \item \textbf{Voltage (\(E\))}: The voltage across a circuit can be calculated using the formula:
    \begin{equation}
        E = I \times R
        \label{eq:voltage}
    \end{equation}
    
    \item \textbf{Resistance (\(R\))}: The resistance of a circuit can be calculated using the formula:
    \begin{equation}
        R = \frac{E}{I}
        \label{eq:resistance}
    \end{equation}
\end{itemize}

These formulas are essential for solving problems in circuit analysis, as demonstrated in the following examples.

\subsection*{Relationship Between Voltage, Current, and Resistance}
The relationship between voltage, current, and resistance is linear, as described by Ohm's Law. This means that if the voltage across a circuit increases, the current will also increase, provided the resistance remains constant. Conversely, if the resistance increases, the current will decrease for a given voltage. This relationship is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:ohms_law}.
