\section{Electrical Units and Concepts}
\label{section:electrical_units_and_concepts}

\subsection*{Introduction}
This section introduces fundamental electrical units and concepts, including electrical current, power, resistance, voltage, frequency, and the distinction between conductors and insulators. These concepts are essential for understanding how electrical circuits function and are foundational for further study in radio technology.

\subsection*{Electrical Current and Its Unit of Measurement}
Electrical current is the flow of electric charge, typically carried by electrons in a conductor. The unit of measurement for electrical current is the \textbf{Ampere} (A), often abbreviated as "Amp." One ampere is defined as the flow of one coulomb of charge per second. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:
\begin{equation}
I = \frac{Q}{t}
\end{equation}
where \( I \) is the current in amperes, \( Q \) is the charge in coulombs, and \( t \) is the time in seconds.

\subsection*{Relationship Between Voltage, Current, and Resistance}
The relationship between voltage (\( V \)), current (\( I \)), and resistance (\( R \)) is described by Ohm's Law:
\begin{equation}
V = I \cdot R
\end{equation}
This equation states that the voltage across a conductor is directly proportional to the current flowing through it and the resistance of the conductor. Voltage is measured in volts (V), current in amperes (A), and resistance in ohms (\(\Omega\)).

\subsection*{Why Metals Are Good Conductors of Electricity}
Metals are generally good conductors of electricity because they have many free electrons that can move easily through the material. These free electrons are not tightly bound to any particular atom, allowing them to flow in response to an applied electric field. This property makes metals highly effective at conducting electrical current.

\subsection*{Frequency and Its Unit of Measurement}
Frequency is the number of cycles of a periodic waveform that occur in one second. The unit of measurement for frequency is the \textbf{Hertz} (Hz), named after the German physicist Heinrich Hertz. One hertz is equivalent to one cycle per second. Frequency is a critical parameter in radio technology, as it determines the wavelength and propagation characteristics of radio waves.

\subsection*{Conductors and Insulators}
Conductors are materials that allow the free flow of electric charge, typically due to the presence of free electrons. Examples of good conductors include metals like copper and aluminum. Insulators, on the other hand, are materials that resist the flow of electric charge. Examples of good insulators include glass, rubber, and plastic. The distinction between conductors and insulators is crucial in designing electrical circuits and components.
