\section{Antenna Basics}
\label{section:antenna_basics}

\subsection*{Beam Antenna}
A beam antenna is designed to concentrate signals in one direction, providing increased gain and directivity compared to omnidirectional antennas. This directional property makes beam antennas particularly useful for long-distance communication, as they can focus energy in a specific direction, reducing interference from other directions. The directional properties of a beam antenna are illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:beam_antenna}.

\end{figure}

\subsection*{Antenna Loading}
Antenna loading refers to the process of electrically lengthening an antenna by inserting inductors or capacitors into its radiating elements. This technique is often used to make an antenna resonant at a desired frequency, especially when physical constraints limit the antenna's size. The process of antenna loading is depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:antenna_loading}.

\end{figure}

\subsection*{Polarization}
Polarization refers to the orientation of the electric field of the radio wave relative to the Earth's surface. A simple dipole antenna oriented parallel to the Earth's surface is horizontally polarized, while one oriented perpendicular to the surface is vertically polarized. The polarization of an antenna affects how well it can transmit and receive signals, especially over long distances.

\subsection*{Antenna Efficiency}
Short, flexible antennas, such as those supplied with handheld transceivers, are often less efficient than full-sized antennas. This is because their reduced size limits their ability to radiate energy effectively, resulting in lower signal strength and range. Full-sized antennas, such as quarter-wave antennas, are more efficient due to their larger radiating elements.

\subsection*{Resonant Frequency}
The resonant frequency of a dipole antenna can be altered by changing its physical length or by adding inductive or capacitive loading. Shortening the antenna increases its resonant frequency, while lengthening it decreases the frequency. This relationship is crucial for tuning antennas to specific frequencies.

\subsection*{Antenna Gain}
Different types of antennas offer varying levels of gain. For example, a Yagi antenna typically provides higher gain compared to isotropic or J-pole antennas. Table~\ref{tab:antenna_gain} compares the gain of different antenna types.

        \textbf{Antenna Type} & \textbf{Gain (dBi)} \\

        Isotropic & 0 \\
        J-pole & 2-3 \\
        5/8 wave vertical & 3-4 \\
        Yagi & 7-10 \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Comparison of Antenna Gain. The table shows the typical gain values for different types of antennas.}

\end{table}

\subsection*{Shielding Effect}
Using a handheld VHF transceiver with a flexible antenna inside a vehicle can reduce signal strength due to the shielding effect of the vehicle's metal body. This shielding blocks or reflects radio waves, reducing the antenna's effectiveness.

\subsection*{Antenna Length Calculations}
The length of a quarter-wavelength vertical antenna for a given frequency can be calculated using the formula:

\begin{equation}
    L = \frac{300}{4f}
    \label{eq:antenna_length}
\end{equation}

where \( L \) is the length in meters and \( f \) is the frequency in MHz. For example, for a frequency of 146 MHz, the length of a quarter-wavelength antenna is approximately 19 inches.
