\subsection*{FT8 Operation}
FT8 is a popular digital mode used in amateur radio for weak signal communication. To operate FT8, the transceiver's audio input and output are connected to a computer running WSJT-X software. This setup allows the computer to process the audio signals for encoding and decoding FT8 messages. The connection typically involves using the computer's sound card to handle the audio signals, ensuring accurate transmission and reception of data.

\subsection*{Computer-Radio Interfaces}
In digital mode operation, the computer-radio interface plays a crucial role. The primary signals used in this interface are receive audio, transmit audio, and transmitter keying. These signals facilitate communication between the computer and the transceiver, enabling the transmission and reception of digital data. The receive audio signal carries the incoming data from the transceiver to the computer, while the transmit audio signal sends data from the computer to the transceiver. The transmitter keying signal controls the transceiver's transmit mode, ensuring proper timing and synchronization.

\subsection*{Digital Mode Hot Spots}
A digital mode hot spot is a device that allows amateur radio operators to communicate using digital voice or data systems via the internet. It acts as a bridge between the transceiver and the internet, enabling communication with other operators worldwide. The hot spot converts the digital signals from the transceiver into a format suitable for internet transmission and vice versa. This setup is particularly useful for accessing digital networks like DMR, D-STAR, and Fusion.

\subsection*{Electronic Keyers}
An electronic keyer is a device that assists in the manual sending of Morse code. It provides a more consistent and accurate keying speed compared to manual keying. The keyer typically includes a paddle that the operator uses to input Morse code, and it generates the corresponding dots and dashes electronically. This device is especially useful for operators who engage in Morse code communication, as it improves the efficiency and accuracy of their transmissions.
