\section{Basic Components and Their Functions}
\label{section:basic_components}

\subsection*{Introduction}
This section introduces the basic components used in electronic circuits, their functions, and their roles in controlling and managing electrical signals. We will discuss resistors, potentiometers, capacitors, inductors, and switches, along with their applications and energy storage mechanisms.

\subsection*{Resistors}
A resistor is a fundamental electrical component that opposes the flow of current in a DC circuit. It is characterized by its resistance, which is measured in ohms ($\Omega$). The relationship between voltage ($V$), current ($I$), and resistance ($R$) is given by Ohm's Law:
\begin{equation}
    V = I \cdot R
\end{equation}
Resistors are commonly used to limit current, divide voltages, and provide biasing in circuits.

\subsection*{Potentiometers}
A potentiometer is a type of variable resistor that allows for adjustable resistance. It consists of a resistive element and a sliding contact (wiper) that moves along the element. Potentiometers are often used as volume controls in audio equipment and as adjustable voltage dividers. The resistance between the wiper and one end of the resistive element changes as the wiper is moved, allowing for precise control of the output voltage.

\subsection*{Capacitors and Inductors}
Capacitors and inductors are energy storage components, but they store energy in different forms. A capacitor stores energy in an electric field, while an inductor stores energy in a magnetic field. The energy stored in a capacitor is given by:
\begin{equation}
    E_C = \frac{1}{2} C V^2
\end{equation}
where $C$ is the capacitance and $V$ is the voltage across the capacitor. Similarly, the energy stored in an inductor is:
\begin{equation}
    E_L = \frac{1}{2} L I^2
\end{equation}
where $L$ is the inductance and $I$ is the current through the inductor.

\subsection*{Switches}
An SPDT (Single Pole Double Throw) switch is a type of switch that connects a single circuit to one of two other circuits. It is commonly used in applications where a single input needs to be switched between two outputs, such as in audio signal routing or mode selection in electronic devices.
