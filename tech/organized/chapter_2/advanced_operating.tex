\subsection*{FM Transmission Distortion}
FM transmission distortion on voice peaks can occur when the input audio signal is too loud, causing over-modulation. This results in distorted audio at the receiving end. To avoid this, ensure that your microphone gain is properly adjusted and avoid speaking too loudly into the microphone. Over-modulation can also be caused by excessive transmit power, but this is less common in modern equipment.

\subsection*{DTMF Signaling}
Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency (DTMF) signaling uses pairs of audio tones to represent numbers, letters, or special characters. This signaling method is commonly used in amateur radio for remote control of repeaters, accessing voicemail systems, and other automated functions. Each DTMF tone is a combination of two frequencies, one from a low-frequency group and one from a high-frequency group.

\subsection*{Digital Repeater Talkgroups}
To join a digital repeater's talkgroup, you need to program your radio with the group's ID or code. Talkgroups allow multiple users to communicate on the same digital repeater without interfering with each other. Each talkgroup has a unique identifier, and your radio must be configured to use the correct ID to access the group. This system is commonly used in DMR (Digital Mobile Radio) networks.

\subsection*{Frequency Interference Management}
When two stations transmit on the same frequency and interfere with each other, they should negotiate continued use of the frequency. This is a common practice in amateur radio to ensure fair and efficient use of the spectrum. The Q signal \textbf{QRM} indicates that you are receiving interference from other stations, while \textbf{QSY} indicates that you are changing frequency to avoid interference.

\subsection*{Questions}
\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title={T2B05}]
    What would cause your FM transmission audio to be distorted on voice peaks?
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*),noitemsep]
        \item Your repeater offset is inverted
        \item You need to talk louder
        \item \textbf{You are talking too loudly}
        \item Your transmit power is too high
    \end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}
Distortion on voice peaks in FM transmission is typically caused by over-modulation, which occurs when the input audio signal is too loud. This can be avoided by adjusting the microphone gain and speaking at a normal volume. Excessive transmit power is less likely to cause distortion in modern equipment.

    What type of signaling uses pairs of audio tones?
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*),noitemsep]
        \item \textbf{DTMF}
        \item CTCSS
        \item GPRS
        \item D-STAR
    \end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}
DTMF (Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency) signaling uses pairs of audio tones to represent numbers, letters, or special characters. This method is widely used in amateur radio for remote control and automated systems.

    How can you join a digital repeater’s “talkgroup”?
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*),noitemsep]
        \item Register your radio with the local FCC office
        \item Join the repeater owner’s club
        \item \textbf{Program your radio with the group’s ID or code}
        \item Sign your call after the courtesy tone
    \end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}
To join a digital repeater's talkgroup, you need to program your radio with the group's ID or code. This allows you to communicate within the designated group without interfering with other users on the same repeater.

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title={T2B08}]
    Which of the following applies when two stations transmitting on the same frequency interfere with each other?
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*),noitemsep]
        \item \textbf{The stations should negotiate continued use of the frequency}
        \item Both stations should choose another frequency to avoid conflict
        \item Interference is inevitable, so no action is required
        \item Use subaudible tones so both stations can share the frequency
    \end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}
When two stations interfere on the same frequency, they should negotiate to determine who will continue using the frequency. This is a common practice in amateur radio to ensure fair use of the spectrum.

    Why are simplex channels designated in the VHF/UHF band plans?
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*),noitemsep]
        \item \textbf{So stations within range of each other can communicate without tying up a repeater}
        \item For contest operation
        \item For working DX only
        \item So stations with simple transmitters can access the repeater without automated offset
    \end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}
Simplex channels are designated in the VHF/UHF band plans to allow stations within range of each other to communicate directly without using a repeater. This is useful for local communication and reduces the load on repeater systems.

    What is the purpose of the color code used on DMR repeater systems?
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*),noitemsep]
        \item \textbf{Must match the repeater color code for access}
        \item Defines the frequency pair to use
        \item Identifies the codec used
        \item Defines the minimum signal level required for access
    \end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}
The color code in DMR repeater systems is used to ensure that your radio matches the repeater's color code for access. This helps prevent unauthorized access and ensures compatibility between radios and repeaters.
