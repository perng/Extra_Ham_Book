\section{Radio Operating Essentials}
\label{section:operating_essentials}

\subsection*{Band Plans}
A band plan is a voluntary guideline for using different modes or activities within an amateur radio band. It helps operators organize their use of the frequency spectrum, ensuring that various types of communications (such as voice, digital, and Morse code) can coexist without interference. Band plans are not enforced by the FCC but are widely adopted by the amateur radio community to promote efficient and harmonious use of the available frequencies.

\subsection*{Simplex vs. Duplex Communication}
Simplex communication refers to a mode where transmission and reception occur on the same frequency. This is commonly used for direct communication between two stations without the need for a repeater. Duplex communication, on the other hand, involves transmitting and receiving on two different frequencies, often facilitated by a repeater. This allows for simultaneous two-way communication, which is particularly useful in scenarios where direct communication is not feasible due to distance or obstacles.

        \hline
        \textbf{Communication Mode} & \textbf{Description} \\
        \hline
        Simplex & Transmission and reception occur on the same frequency. \\
        \hline
        Duplex & Transmission and reception occur on different frequencies. \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection*{CTCSS and DTMF Tones}
CTCSS (Continuous Tone-Coded Squelch System) and DTMF (Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency) tones are used in repeater operations to control access and improve communication quality. CTCSS tones are sub-audible tones transmitted along with normal voice audio to open the squelch of a receiver, ensuring that only signals with the correct tone are heard. DTMF tones, on the other hand, are used for remote control of repeaters and other equipment, allowing operators to perform functions like changing frequencies or activating features.

\subsection*{Linked Repeater Networks}
A linked repeater network is a system where multiple repeaters are interconnected, allowing signals received by one repeater to be transmitted by all the repeaters in the network. This extends the range of communication and enables operators to communicate over much larger areas than would be possible with a single repeater. Linked repeater networks are particularly useful in emergency situations where wide-area communication is essential.

\subsection*{Questions}
\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title={T2A09}]
    Which of the following indicates that a station is listening on a repeater and looking for a contact?
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*,noitemsep]
        \item “CQ CQ” followed by the repeater’s call sign
        \item \textbf{The station’s call sign followed by the word “monitoring”}
        \item The repeater call sign followed by the station’s call sign
        \item “QSY” followed by your call sign
    \end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}
When a station is monitoring a repeater and looking for a contact, it typically identifies itself by its call sign followed by the word "monitoring." This indicates that the station is listening and available for communication.

    What is a band plan, beyond the privileges established by the FCC?
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*,noitemsep]
        \item \textbf{A voluntary guideline for using different modes or activities within an amateur band}
        \item A list of operating schedules
        \item A list of available net frequencies
        \item A plan devised by a club to indicate frequency band usage
    \end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}
A band plan is a voluntary guideline that helps amateur radio operators organize their use of the frequency spectrum. It is not enforced by the FCC but is widely adopted to ensure efficient and harmonious use of the available frequencies.

    What term describes an amateur station that is transmitting and receiving on the same frequency?
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*,noitemsep]
        \item Full duplex
        \item Diplex
        \item \textbf{Simplex}
        \item Multiplex
    \end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

    What should you do before calling CQ?
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*,noitemsep]
        \item Listen first to be sure that no one else is using the frequency
        \item Ask if the frequency is in use
        \item Make sure you are authorized to use that frequency
        \item \textbf{All these choices are correct}
    \end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}
Before calling CQ, it is important to listen to ensure the frequency is not in use, ask if the frequency is in use, and confirm that you are authorized to use that frequency. All these steps are essential to avoid interference and ensure proper operation.

    How is a VHF/UHF transceiver’s “reverse” function used?
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*,noitemsep]
        \item To reduce power output
        \item To increase power output
        \item \textbf{To listen on a repeater’s input frequency}
        \item To listen on a repeater’s output frequency
    \end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}
The "reverse" function on a VHF/UHF transceiver is used to listen on a repeater's input frequency. This allows the operator to hear what is being transmitted directly to the repeater, which can be useful for troubleshooting or monitoring.

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title={T2B02}]
    What term describes the use of a sub-audible tone transmitted along with normal voice audio to open the squelch of a receiver?
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*,noitemsep]
        \item Carrier squelch
        \item Tone burst
        \item DTMF
        \item \textbf{CTCSS}
    \end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}
CTCSS (Continuous Tone-Coded Squelch System) uses a sub-audible tone transmitted along with normal voice audio to open the squelch of a receiver. This ensures that only signals with the correct tone are heard, reducing interference from other transmissions.

    Which of the following describes a linked repeater network?
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*,noitemsep]
        \item \textbf{A network of repeaters in which signals received by one repeater are transmitted by all the repeaters in the network}
        \item A single repeater with more than one receiver
        \item Multiple repeaters with the same control operator
        \item A system of repeaters linked by APRS
    \end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}
A linked repeater network is a system where multiple repeaters are interconnected, allowing signals received by one repeater to be transmitted by all the repeaters in the network. This extends the range of communication and is particularly useful in emergency situations.

    Which of the following could be the reason you are unable to access a repeater whose output you can hear?
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*,noitemsep]
        \item Improper transceiver offset
        \item You are using the wrong CTCSS tone
        \item You are using the wrong DCS code
        \item \textbf{All these choices are correct}
    \end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}
If you can hear a repeater's output but cannot access it, the issue could be due to an improper transceiver offset, using the wrong CTCSS tone, or using the wrong DCS code. All these factors can prevent successful communication with the repeater.
