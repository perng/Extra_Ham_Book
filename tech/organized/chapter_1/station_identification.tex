\section{Station Identification and Third-Party Communications}
\label{sec:station_identification}

\subsection*{Station Identification Rules}
Station identification is a critical requirement for amateur radio operators to ensure compliance with FCC regulations. The rules mandate that operators transmit their FCC-assigned call sign at specific intervals and under certain conditions. When using tactical call signs, such as "Race Headquarters," the FCC-assigned call sign must still be used at the end of each communication and every ten minutes during a communication. This ensures that the station's identity is clearly established, even when using temporary or situational identifiers.

\subsection*{Third-Party Communications}
Third-party communications involve transmitting messages on behalf of someone who is not the control operator. The control operator must ensure that the foreign station is in a country with which the U.S. has a third-party agreement. The control operator is also responsible for station identification during such communications. This rule ensures accountability and compliance with international agreements.

\subsection*{Language Restrictions}
When operating in a phone sub-band, station identification must be in English. This requirement ensures clarity and consistency in communication, particularly in international contexts where multiple languages may be in use.

\subsection*{Self-Assigned Indicators}
Self-assigned indicators, such as "KL7CC/W3," are acceptable in call signs during phone transmissions. These indicators can be used to denote location, club affiliation, or other relevant information. However, the FCC-assigned call sign must still be transmitted as required.

        Station Identification & Transmit FCC-assigned call sign at the end of each communication and every 10 minutes. \\
        Tactical Call Signs & Use FCC-assigned call sign with tactical identifiers as needed. \\

\subsection*{Questions}
\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title={T1F01}]
    When must the station and its records be available for FCC inspection?
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*,noitemsep]
        \item At any time ten days after notification by the FCC of such an inspection
        \item \textbf{At any time upon request by an FCC representative}
        \item At any time after written notification by the FCC of such inspection
        \item Only when presented with a valid warrant by an FCC official or government agent
    \end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}
The station and its records must be available for inspection at any time upon request by an FCC representative. This ensures compliance with FCC regulations and allows for immediate verification of station operations.

    How often must you identify with your FCC-assigned call sign when using tactical call signs such as “Race Headquarters”?
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*,noitemsep]
        \item Never, the tactical call is sufficient
        \item Once during every hour
        \item \textbf{At the end of each communication and every ten minutes during a communication}
        \item At the end of every transmission
    \end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}
When using tactical call signs, the FCC-assigned call sign must be transmitted at the end of each communication and every ten minutes during a communication. This ensures proper identification even when using temporary call signs.

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title={T1F03}]
    When are you required to transmit your assigned call sign?
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*,noitemsep]
        \item At the beginning of each contact, and every 10 minutes thereafter
        \item At least once during each transmission
        \item At least every 15 minutes during and at the end of a communication
        \item \textbf{At least every 10 minutes during and at the end of a communication}
    \end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}
The assigned call sign must be transmitted at least every 10 minutes during and at the end of a communication. This rule ensures consistent identification of the station.

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title={T1F04}]
    What language may you use for identification when operating in a phone sub-band?
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*,noitemsep]
        \item Any language recognized by the United Nations
        \item Any language recognized by the ITU
        \item \textbf{English}
        \item English, French, or Spanish
    \end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}
When operating in a phone sub-band, station identification must be in English. This ensures clarity and consistency in communication.

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title={T1F05}]
    What method of call sign identification is required for a station transmitting phone signals?
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*,noitemsep]
        \item Send the call sign followed by the indicator RPT
        \item \textbf{Send the call sign using a CW or phone emission}
        \item Send the call sign followed by the indicator R
        \item Send the call sign using only a phone emission
    \end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}
For phone transmissions, the call sign must be sent using either CW (Morse code) or phone emission. This ensures that the call sign is clearly transmitted and understood.
