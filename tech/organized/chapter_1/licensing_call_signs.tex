\section{Licensing and Call Sign Protocols}
\label{sec:licensing_call_signs}

\subsection*{License Classes and Availability}
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) currently offers three license classes for amateur radio operators: Technician, General, and Amateur Extra. Each class grants specific operating privileges, with the Technician class being the entry-level license. The General class provides additional frequency privileges, while the Amateur Extra class offers the most extensive operating privileges, including access to all amateur radio bands.

\subsection*{Vanity Call Sign Rules}
Amateur radio operators may select a desired call sign under the vanity call sign rules. Any licensed amateur, regardless of license class, is eligible to apply for a vanity call sign. The process involves submitting an application to the FCC, which is then reviewed for compliance with the rules. Figure~\ref{fig:vanity_call_sign_flow} illustrates the vanity call sign application process.

\subsection*{International Communications}
FCC-licensed amateur radio stations are permitted to make international communications that are incidental to the purposes of the Amateur Radio Service. This includes remarks of a personal character, but excludes communications for business purposes. These rules ensure that amateur radio remains a non-commercial service.

\subsection*{License Renewal and Revocation}
Maintaining accurate contact information with the FCC is crucial. Failure to provide and maintain a correct email address can result in the revocation of the station license or suspension of the operator license. Additionally, amateur radio licenses are typically issued for a term of ten years and must be renewed before expiration.
