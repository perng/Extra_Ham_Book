\section{Frequency Coordination and Band Usage}
\label{sec:frequency_coordination}

\subsection*{Role of Frequency Coordinators}
Volunteer frequency coordinators play a crucial role in managing the allocation of transmit/receive channels and other parameters for auxiliary and repeater stations. These coordinators are recognized by local amateur operators and are responsible for ensuring efficient use of the frequency spectrum. They are selected by amateur operators in a local or regional area whose stations are eligible to be repeater or auxiliary stations. This decentralized approach allows for flexibility and adaptability to local needs.

\subsection*{Frequency Ranges for Technician Licensees}
Technician class licensees have access to specific frequency ranges for phone operation. These include the 28.300 MHz to 28.500 MHz segment of the 10-meter band. This range is particularly useful for voice communication and is a key privilege for Technician licensees.

\subsection*{International Space Station (ISS) Communication}
Amateur radio operators holding a Technician class or higher license are permitted to contact the International Space Station (ISS) on VHF bands. This privilege allows for direct communication with astronauts and participation in educational outreach programs.

\subsection*{Amateur Band Segments and Their Usage}
Amateur radio bands are divided into segments, each with specific uses and operating privileges. Technician class operators have access to various frequency bands, with different permitted modes of operation in each segment.
