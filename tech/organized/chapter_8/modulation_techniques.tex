\section{Modulation Techniques}
\label{section:modulation_techniques}

\subsection*{Introduction}
Modulation techniques are fundamental to radio communication, enabling the transmission of information over long distances. This section explores the differences between Amplitude Modulation (AM), Frequency Modulation (FM), and Single Sideband (SSB) modulation. We will also discuss the bandwidth requirements for different types of signals and the advantages and disadvantages of SSB compared to FM. Finally, we will explain the concept of sideband selection in SSB communications.

\subsection*{Differences Between AM, FM, and SSB}
Amplitude Modulation (AM) varies the amplitude of the carrier wave in proportion to the signal being transmitted. Frequency Modulation (FM), on the other hand, varies the frequency of the carrier wave. Single Sideband (SSB) is a form of AM that eliminates one sideband and the carrier, resulting in a more efficient use of bandwidth.

\subsection*{Bandwidth Requirements}
The bandwidth of a signal is a critical factor in radio communication. SSB signals typically require less bandwidth compared to AM and FM signals. For example, a typical SSB voice signal has an approximate bandwidth of 3 kHz, while FM voice signals can require up to 15 kHz. Continuous Wave (CW) signals, used in Morse code, have the narrowest bandwidth, often less than 1 kHz.

\subsection*{Advantages and Disadvantages of SSB}
SSB offers several advantages over FM, including narrower bandwidth and greater power efficiency. However, SSB signals can be more challenging to tune correctly and are more susceptible to interference. FM, while requiring more bandwidth, provides better signal quality and is easier to tune.

\subsection*{Sideband Selection in SSB Communications}
In SSB communications, the choice of upper or lower sideband depends on the frequency band being used. For example, upper sideband is typically used for 10 meter HF, VHF, and UHF communications. This selection helps optimize the transmission for the specific frequency range.

    Which of the following is a form of amplitude modulation?
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*,noitemsep]
        \item Spread spectrum

    \end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}
SSB is a form of amplitude modulation that eliminates one sideband and the carrier. Spread spectrum and packet radio are not forms of amplitude modulation, and PSK is a type of phase modulation.
