\subsection*{Radio Direction Finding}
Radio direction finding (RDF) is a technique used to locate the source of a radio signal. This method is particularly useful for identifying sources of noise interference or jamming. The process involves using a directional antenna to determine the bearing of the signal. By taking multiple bearings from different locations, the source of the signal can be triangulated. RDF is widely used in amateur radio for activities such as fox hunting, where participants locate hidden transmitters.

\subsection*{Contesting}
Contesting is a popular activity in amateur radio where operators attempt to contact as many stations as possible within a specified period. This activity tests the operator's ability to make quick and efficient contacts, often under challenging conditions. Contesting helps improve operating skills and can be a fun way to engage with the amateur radio community.

\subsection*{Grid Locator}
A grid locator is a letter-number designator assigned to a geographic location. It is used in amateur radio to provide a concise way to describe a station's location. The grid locator system divides the Earth into a grid of squares, each identified by a unique combination of letters and numbers. This system is particularly useful for activities like contesting and DXing, where precise location information is important.

\subsection*{VoIP and IRLP}
Voice Over Internet Protocol (VoIP) is a method of delivering voice communications over the internet using digital techniques. In amateur radio, VoIP is used to connect stations over the internet, allowing for long-distance communication without the need for traditional radio waves. The Internet Radio Linking Project (IRLP) is a technique that connects amateur radio systems, such as repeaters, via the internet using VoIP. This allows operators to communicate with others around the world through their local repeater.

\subsection*{Questions}
\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title={T8C01}]
    Which of the following methods is used to locate sources of noise interference or jamming?
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*,noitemsep]
        \item Echolocation
        \item Doppler radar
        \item \textbf{Radio direction finding}
        \item Phase locking
    \end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}
Radio direction finding is the correct method for locating sources of noise interference or jamming. Echolocation and Doppler radar are not applicable in this context, and phase locking is unrelated to locating interference sources.
