\subsection{Operating Locations}
\label{subsec:operating-location}

When it comes to operating your FCC-licensed amateur station, the rules about where you can transmit are pretty straightforward, but they do have some interesting nuances. Let's dive into the specifics, especially when it comes to operating from international waters.

First off, you might be wondering, "Can I just set up my station anywhere in the world and start transmitting?" Well, not quite. The FCC has some clear guidelines on this. According to FCC regulations, an FCC-licensed amateur station can transmit from any vessel or craft located in international waters, provided that the vessel or craft is documented or registered in the United States. This means that if you're on a U.S.-registered boat in the middle of the ocean, you're good to go!

But what about on land? The rules are a bit different there. You can't just set up shop in any country and start transmitting. The FCC doesn't have jurisdiction outside the United States, so you need to be mindful of the local laws and regulations of the country you're in. However, if you're in a country that belongs to the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), you might have some leeway, but it's always best to check with the local authorities.

Now, let's talk about international waters. These are areas of the ocean that are not under the jurisdiction of any single country. If you're on a U.S.-registered vessel in these waters, you're essentially operating under U.S. jurisdiction, which means you can transmit as long as you follow FCC rules. This is a great option for those who love to combine their passion for amateur radio with a bit of maritime adventure.

% To help visualize this, take a look at Figure~\ref{fig:operating-locations-map}, which shows the permissible operating locations for FCC-licensed amateur stations. The map highlights the areas where you can legally operate your station, including international waters.

\subsubsection{Questions}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title={T1C06}]
    From which of the following locations may an FCC-licensed amateur station transmit?
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*),noitemsep]
        \item From within any country that belongs to the International Telecommunication Union
        \item From within any country that is a member of the United Nations
        \item From anywhere within International Telecommunication Union (ITU) Regions 2 and 3
        \item \textbf{From any vessel or craft located in international waters and documented or registered in the United States}
    \end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

 According to FCC regulations, an FCC-licensed amateur station may transmit from any vessel or craft located in international waters, provided that the vessel or craft is documented or registered in the United States. This is a specific provision that allows amateur radio operators to operate in international waters under U.S. jurisdiction. Options A, B, and C are incorrect because they do not align with the FCC's specific rules regarding operating locations. While ITU membership or UN membership might imply certain international agreements, they do not override the FCC's jurisdiction requirements for amateur radio operations.
