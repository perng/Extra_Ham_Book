Before we dive into FCC regulations and radio operations, we need to understand some fundamental electrical concepts. Think of these as the ABCs of radio - without knowing these basics, many of the rules and regulations won't make much sense. After all, how can you understand power limits or frequency allocations if you don't know what power or frequency means? So let's build our foundation with some core electrical concepts that will make everything else click into place.


\subsection{Core Definitions}
\label{subsec:minimal-core-defs}

Let's divert to learn  some core definitions that are essential for understanding radio technology. These concepts are the building blocks of everything we'll discuss later, so let's make sure we're on the same page (pun intended). We will discuss these concepts in more detail in Section~\ref{subsec:core-defs}. Here are the essential concepts for understanding FCC rules.

\subsubsection*{Frequency}
Frequency is the number of complete cycles that occur in one second, measured in Hertz (Hz). In radio terms, it's how many times the electromagnetic wave completes a full oscillation each second. For example:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item 1 Hz = 1 cycle per second
    \item 1 kHz = 1,000 cycles per second
    \item 1 MHz = 1,000,000 cycles per second
\end{itemize}

Different radio services operate on different frequencies, which is why the FCC allocates specific frequency bands for different purposes. Think of it like different radio stations on your car radio - each one has its own frequency!

\subsubsection*{Electrical Power}
Electrical power is the rate at which electrical energy is transferred by an electric circuit. In simpler terms, it's how much "oomph" your radio signal has. The unit of power is the \textbf{Watt} (W), named after the Scottish engineer James Watt. You might have heard of other units like volts or amperes, but when it comes to power, watts are the star of the show. 

In radio technology, power is everything. It determines how far your signal can travel and how well it can overcome obstacles. Whether you're transmitting a signal or receiving one, power is the key player.

\subsubsection{Questions}


\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title={T5A10}]
    Which term describes the rate at which electrical energy is used?
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*),noitemsep]
        \item Resistance
        \item Current
        \item \textbf{Power}
        \item Voltage
    \end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}
Power is the rate at which electrical energy is used. Resistance opposes current, current is the flow of charge, and voltage is the force that causes the flow.

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title={T5A02}]
    Electrical power is measured in which of the following units?
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*),noitemsep]
        \item Volts
        \item \textbf{Watts}
        \item Watt-hours
        \item Amperes
    \end{enumerate}
    \end{tcolorbox}
    Electrical power is measured in watts. Volts measure voltage, amperes measure current, and watt-hours measure energy, not power.
