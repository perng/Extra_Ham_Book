\subsection{Penalties for Violations}
\label{subsec:penalties}

When it comes to amateur radio, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has a set of rules that must be followed to ensure the airwaves remain orderly and interference-free. But what happens when someone breaks these rules? Let's dive into the world of penalties, accountability, and how to avoid getting on the FCC's naughty list.

\subsubsection*{Repeater Violations Accountability}
Imagine this: you're using a repeater to extend your signal's reach, and suddenly, it retransmits something that violates FCC rules. Who's to blame? According to the FCC, the control operator of the originating station is accountable. Yes, that's right—it's not the repeater's fault, nor the repeater owner's. The buck stops with the person who started the transmission. This is outlined in FCC Part 97, which states that the control operator is responsible for ensuring that all transmissions comply with the rules.

\subsubsection*{Club Station License Requirements}
Now, let's talk about club stations. If you're part of a radio club and want to get a club station license, there are a few hoops to jump through. First, the club must have at least \textbf{four members}. That's right—no three-member clubs allowed! Additionally, the trustee of the club station doesn't need to have an Amateur Extra Class license, and the club doesn't need to be registered with the American Radio Relay League (ARRL). So, if you're thinking of starting a club, make sure you have enough members to meet the FCC's requirements.

\subsubsection*{Penalties for FCC Rule Violations}
Violating FCC rules can lead to some serious consequences. The penalties can range from fines to license revocation, depending on the severity of the violation. To give you a clearer picture, here's a table summarizing the penalties for different types of FCC rule violations in amateur radio.

\subsubsection*{Questions}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title={T1F10}]
    Who is accountable if a repeater inadvertently retransmits communications that violate the FCC rules?
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*),noitemsep]
        \item \textbf{The control operator of the originating station}
        \item The control operator of the repeater
        \item The owner of the repeater
        \item Both the originating station and the repeater owner
    \end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

The control operator of the originating station is accountable because they are responsible for ensuring that all transmissions comply with FCC rules. The repeater and its owner are not held accountable for retransmitting violations that originated elsewhere.

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title={T1F11}]
    Which of the following is a requirement for the issuance of a club station license grant?
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*),noitemsep]
        \item The trustee must have an Amateur Extra Class operator license grant
        \item \textbf{The club must have at least four members}
        \item The club must be registered with the American Radio Relay League
        \item All these choices are correct
    \end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

The club must have at least four members to qualify for a club station license grant. The trustee does not need to have an Amateur Extra Class license, and the club does not need to be registered with the ARRL. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.
