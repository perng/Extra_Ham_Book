\subsection{Packet Basics}
\label{subsec:packet-basics}

Packet radio is a fascinating digital communication mode that has been a cornerstone of amateur radio for decades. Unlike traditional analog modes, packet radio breaks data into discrete packets, each containing a header, payload, and checksum. This structure allows for efficient and reliable communication, even in noisy environments. The header typically includes the call sign of the destination station, ensuring that the packet reaches the correct recipient. The payload carries the actual data, while the checksum is used for error detection, ensuring the integrity of the transmitted information.

\subsubsection*{Error Detection and Checksums}
One of the key features of packet radio is its robust error detection mechanism. Each packet includes a checksum, which is a mathematical value calculated from the data in the packet. When the packet is received, the checksum is recalculated and compared to the one sent. If they match, the packet is considered error-free. If not, the packet is discarded, and the sender is notified to retransmit the data. This process is crucial for maintaining the reliability of communication, especially in environments with high levels of interference.

\subsubsection*{Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ)}
To further enhance reliability, packet radio employs an Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ) mechanism. If a packet is lost or corrupted during transmission, the receiver sends a request to the sender to retransmit the packet. This process continues until the packet is successfully received. ARQ ensures that data is delivered accurately, even in challenging conditions. The flowchart in Figure~\ref{fig:arq-process} illustrates this process in detail.

\subsubsection*{Morse Code and Packet Radio}
While Morse code (CW) is often associated with analog communication, it is actually a digital mode. Morse code represents information as a series of on-off keying (OOK) signals, which can be considered a form of digital modulation. However, Morse code is fundamentally different from packet radio, as it does not use packets or error detection mechanisms. Instead, Morse code relies on the operator's skill to interpret the signals, making it a unique and enduring mode of communication.
