\subsection{FT8 and Weak-Signal Modes}
\label{subsec:ft8-weak}

In this section, we'll dive into the fascinating world of FT8 and other weak-signal modes, which have revolutionized amateur radio communication, especially under challenging propagation conditions. Let's start by exploring the FT8 digital mode, its unique characteristics, and why it's so well-suited for low signal-to-noise operation.

\subsubsection*{What is FT8?}
FT8 is a digital mode specifically designed for weak-signal communication. It's part of the WSJT-X software suite, which is a collection of tools aimed at making the most out of marginal propagation conditions. FT8 stands out because it can decode signals that are barely above the noise floor, making it ideal for long-distance communication when traditional modes might fail. The mode uses a combination of forward error correction (FEC) and a highly efficient modulation scheme to achieve this. Think of it as a digital whisper that can travel thousands of miles, even when the conditions are less than ideal.

\subsubsection*{Weak-Signal Propagation Modes in WSJT-X}
The WSJT-X software suite supports a variety of weak-signal propagation modes, each tailored for specific conditions. For example, Earth-Moon-Earth (EME) communication, also known as "moonbounce," involves bouncing signals off the moon to communicate with stations on the other side of the globe. Another interesting mode is meteor scatter, where signals are reflected off the ionized trails left by meteors entering the Earth's atmosphere. These modes are particularly useful when traditional propagation paths are unavailable or unreliable.

\subsubsection*{Advantages of FT8 and Weak-Signal Modes}
One of the biggest advantages of FT8 and other weak-signal modes is their ability to maintain communication over long distances, even when the signal is extremely weak. This is particularly useful during periods of low solar activity when the ionosphere is less reflective. Additionally, these modes are highly automated, allowing for efficient communication with minimal manual intervention. This makes them accessible to a wide range of operators, from beginners to seasoned experts.

\subsubsection{Questions}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white,colframe=black!75!black,title={T8D10}]
    Which of the following operating activities is supported by digital mode software in the WSJT-X software suite?
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*),noitemsep]
        \item Earth-Moon-Earth
