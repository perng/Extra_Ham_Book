\subsection{Satellite Telemetry and Beacons}
\label{subsec:sat-telemetry-beacons}

Satellite telemetry and beacons are essential components of amateur radio satellites. They provide critical information about the satellite's health, status, and operational parameters. Let's dive into what these terms mean and why they are important.

\subsubsection*{Purpose and Types of Telemetry Information}
Satellite beacons transmit telemetry data, which is essentially the satellite's way of saying, "Hey, I'm still alive and here's how I'm doing!" This data typically includes information about the satellite's health and status, such as battery voltage, temperature, and the status of various subsystems. For example, if the satellite's solar panels are not generating enough power, the telemetry data will reflect that. This information is crucial for ground operators to monitor and maintain the satellite's functionality.

\subsubsection*{Common Modes of Transmission}
Amateur radio satellites use various modes of transmission to communicate with ground stations. These modes include Single Sideband (SSB), Frequency Modulation (FM), and Continuous Wave (CW)/data. Each mode has its advantages and is chosen based on the specific requirements of the mission. For instance, SSB is often used for voice communication, while CW/data is preferred for telemetry and beacon signals due to its efficiency and simplicity.

\subsubsection*{What is a Satellite Beacon?}
A satellite beacon is a continuous transmission from a satellite that contains status information. Think of it as the satellite's heartbeat, constantly sending out signals to let us know it's operational. This beacon is not just a simple signal; it carries vital telemetry data that helps operators on the ground monitor the satellite's health and performance.
