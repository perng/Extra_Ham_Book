\subsection{Basics}
\label{subsec:basics-passive}

Let's dive into the fundamental components that make up the backbone of any electronic circuit. These components are like the unsung heroes of the electronics world—often overlooked but absolutely essential. We'll start with resistors, capacitors, inductors, and switches, and then move on to some battery chemistry basics. By the end of this section, you'll have a solid understanding of how these components work and why they're so important.

\subsubsection*{Resistors: The Traffic Cops of Current}
A resistor is like the traffic cop of a DC circuit—it controls the flow of current. When current tries to flow through a resistor, it faces opposition, which we call resistance. This opposition is measured in ohms ($\Omega$). The higher the resistance, the harder it is for current to flow. This relationship is described by Ohm's Law (Equation~\ref{eq:ohms-law}).

\subsubsection*{Potentiometers: The Volume Knob}
Ever wondered how the volume knob on your stereo works? That's a potentiometer in action! A potentiometer is essentially a variable resistor. It has three terminals: two fixed ends and a movable wiper. By adjusting the wiper, you can change the resistance between the wiper and one of the fixed ends. This is how you control the volume—by adjusting the resistance, you control the amount of current flowing through the circuit, which in turn controls the volume.

\subsubsection*{Capacitors: The Energy Storage Tanks}
Capacitors are like tiny energy storage tanks. They store energy in an electric field between two conductive plates separated by an insulator (called a dielectric). The amount of energy a capacitor can store is determined by its capacitance, measured in farads (F). The basic formula for capacitance is:
\begin{equation}
    C = \frac{Q}{V}
\end{equation}
where $C$ is capacitance, $Q$ is charge, and $V$ is voltage. Capacitors are used in a variety of applications, from filtering out noise in power supplies to timing circuits.

\subsubsection*{Inductors: The Magnetic Field Generators}
Inductors are the magnetic counterparts to capacitors. Instead of storing energy in an electric field, they store it in a magnetic field. An inductor is typically constructed as a coil of wire, and when current flows through it, a magnetic field is generated. The strength of this magnetic field depends on the inductance, measured in henries (H). Inductors are often used in filters and oscillators, where they help to smooth out current or generate specific frequencies.

\subsubsection*{SPDT Switches: The Circuit Directors}
An SPDT (Single-Pole Double-Throw) switch is like a railroad switch for circuits. It allows you to direct the flow of current between two different paths. Unlike a simple on/off switch, an SPDT switch can switch a single circuit between one of two other circuits. This makes it incredibly versatile for controlling complex circuits.

\subsubsection*{Fuses: The Circuit Protectors}
Fuses are the unsung heroes of circuit protection. They are designed to break the circuit if the current exceeds a certain level, thereby protecting other components from damage. Think of them as the circuit's emergency brake. When too much current flows through a fuse, the wire inside it melts, breaking the circuit and stopping the flow of current.

\subsubsection*{Battery Chemistries: The Power Source}
Batteries come in all shapes and sizes, but they can be broadly categorized into rechargeable and non-rechargeable types. Rechargeable batteries, like Nickel-Metal Hydride (NiMH), Lithium-Ion (Li-ion), and Lead-Acid, can be recharged multiple times, making them more cost-effective and environmentally friendly in the long run. Non-rechargeable batteries, like Carbon-Zinc, are typically used in low-drain devices and are disposed of after use.

\subsubsection*{Single-Pole Single-Throw Switches: The Simplest Switch}
A Single-Pole Single-Throw (SPST) switch is the simplest type of switch. It has two terminals and can either open or close a single circuit. When the switch is closed, current flows; when it's open, the circuit is broken. It's the most basic form of switch and is used in a wide variety of applications.
